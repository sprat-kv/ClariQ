def get_policy_verdict(query: str) -> dict:
    """
    Analyzes a user query against the policy corpus to determine if it is compliant.

    This function will perform the following steps:
    1.  Initialize clients for the LLM (e.g., `AzureChatOpenAI`) and the
        vector store retriever that holds the policy embeddings.
    2.  Create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chain. This chain will:
        a.  Take the user's query.
        b.  Retrieve relevant policy document chunks from the vector store.
        c.  Format the retrieved documents and the query into a prompt.
    3.  Pass the prompt to the LLM to get a structured response.
    4.  The LLM's task is to classify the query into one of three categories:
        - "ALLOW": The query is fully compliant.
        - "REWRITE": The query is partially compliant but needs modification.
        - "BLOCK": The query violates policy and must be denied.
    5.  The function will also capture the reason for the verdict, especially
        for "REWRITE" and "BLOCK" cases, citing the retrieved policy snippets.
    6.  Return a dictionary containing the verdict and the reasoning.
