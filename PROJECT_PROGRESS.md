### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundational Setup & Data Layer (Completed)

*   **Goal**: Establish the project's structure, set up the database, and load it with the necessary data.
*   **Status**: **100% Complete and Verified.**
*   **Tasks Accomplished**:
    *   **Project Structure**: Created all necessary directories (`db`, `scripts`, `notebooks`, `src`, `policy_corpus`).
    *   **Dependency Management**: Switched from `requirements.txt` to `pyproject.toml` and configured the project to use `uv` for environment and package management.
    *   **Database Schema**: Defined the table structures for `patients`, `conditions`, `encounters`, etc., in `db/schema.sql`.
    *   **Data Loading**:
        *   Initially attempted to load data with a Python script (`scripts/load_data.py`).
        *   Debugged and resolved connection issues related to special characters in the password by implementing URL encoding.
        *   Identified schema mismatches between the CSV files and the database tables.
        *   Successfully loaded all data by manually transforming and inserting it using the `1.0-data-loading.ipynb` notebook.
