# G-SIA Project Progress Tracker

This document tracks the implementation progress of the GovAI Secure Intelligence Assistant (G-SIA) project, broken down by phase.

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundational Setup & Data Layer (Completed)

*   **Goal**: Establish the project's structure, set up the database, and load it with the necessary data.
*   **Status**: **100% Complete and Verified.**
*   **Tasks Accomplished**:
    *   **Project Structure**: Created all necessary directories (`db`, `scripts`, `notebooks`, `src`, `policy_corpus`).
    *   **Dependency Management**: Switched from `requirements.txt` to `pyproject.toml` and configured the project to use `uv` for environment and package management.
    *   **Database Schema**: Defined the table structures for `patients`, `conditions`, `encounters`, etc., in `db/schema.sql`.
    *   **Data Loading**:
        *   Initially attempted to load data with a Python script (`scripts/load_data.py`).
        *   Debugged and resolved connection issues related to special characters in the password by implementing URL encoding.
        *   Identified schema mismatches between the CSV files and the database tables.
        *   Successfully loaded all data by manually transforming and inserting it using the `1.0-data-loading.ipynb` notebook.

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Policy Enforcement Engine (RAG) (Completed)

*   **Goal**: Build the core AI component that classifies user queries based on a corpus of compliance documents.
*   **Status**: **100% Complete and Verified.**
*   **Tasks Accomplished**:
    1.  **Content-Aware Document Parser**: Implemented sophisticated NLP-based parsing that preserves GDPR recitals/chapters and HIPAA titles/sections structure.
    2.  **Intelligent Chunking System**: Created dynamic chunking with optimized sizes (800 tokens target) and intelligent overlapping for context preservation.
    3.  **Qdrant Vector Store**: Integrated high-performance vector database with metadata-rich indexing and filtering capabilities.
    4.  **Advanced Policy Agent**: Built comprehensive compliance analysis system with:
        *   Multi-regulation support (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA)
        *   Structured verdict system (ALLOW/REWRITE/BLOCK)
        *   Confidence scoring and risk assessment
        *   Detailed reasoning with policy citations
    5.  **Production-Ready Build System**: Created automated build script (`scripts/build_rag_system.py`) for easy deployment.
    6.  **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified system with various query types:
        *   ‚úÖ Correctly BLOCKS requests for PII (SSNs, direct patient data)
        *   ‚úÖ ALLOWS compliant analytical queries (patient counts, policy information)
        *   ‚úÖ Provides detailed reasoning and compliance citations
        *   ‚úÖ Processes 366 chunks from 196 policy sections across 3 documents

### ‚è≥ Phase 3: Core Agent Implementation (Up Next)

*   **Goal**: Develop the other agents needed for the chatbot's workflow.
*   **Status**: **Ready to begin. Policy Agent foundation is complete.**
*   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    *   **Implement `SQL Agent`**: Create an agent that can convert natural language questions (approved by the `Policy Agent`) into safe, parameterized SQL queries using the LangChain SQL Toolkit.
    *   **Implement `Query Rewriter`**: Create an agent that takes a query marked as `REWRITE` and modifies it to be compliant (e.g., by removing a request for PII or adding aggregation).

---

### üìã Phase 4: LangGraph Orchestration (Future)

*   **Goal**: Connect all the agents into a logical, stateful workflow.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Define a graph state that tracks the query, agent verdicts, and final results.
    *   Define nodes for each agent (`Policy Agent`, `Query Rewriter`, `SQL Agent`).
    *   Implement conditional edges to create the workflow logic (e.g., if the verdict is `REWRITE`, route to the `Query Rewriter`; if `ALLOW`, route to the `SQL Agent`).

---

### üìã Phase 5: API & Backend Integration (Future)

*   **Goal**: Expose the AI system to the outside world through a secure API.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Build a FastAPI application.
    *   Create a REST endpoint (e.g., `/query`) that accepts a user's question.
    *   This endpoint will invoke the LangGraph application and return the final, formatted response.

---

### üìã Phase 6: Security & Observability (Future)

*   **Goal**: Harden the application and ensure all actions are traceable.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   **Secrets Management**: Integrate Azure Key Vault to manage all sensitive credentials (database connection strings, API keys) instead of using the `.env` file in production.
    *   **Observability**: Configure LangSmith to trace the internal reasoning of the agents for debugging and monitoring.
    *   **Auditing**: Implement a robust logging middleware in FastAPI to send audit logs to Azure Monitor for compliance purposes.

---

### üìã Phase 7: Testing & Finalization (Future)

*   **Goal**: Ensure the application is reliable, well-documented, and ready for deployment.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Write unit tests for individual agents and functions.
    *   Write integration tests for the complete LangGraph workflow.
    *   Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application.
    *   Refine the `README.md` with final, verified setup instructions.
