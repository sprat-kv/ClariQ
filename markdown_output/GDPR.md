on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
movement of such data, and repealing Directiv e 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)
(Text with EEA relevance)
## The Eur Opean Parliament And The Council Of The Eur Opean Union,
Having regar d to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 16 thereof,
Having regar d to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draf t legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regar d to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committ ee (1),
Having regar d to the opinion of the Committ ee of the Regions (2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinar y legislative procedure (3),
Whereas:
(1) The protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right.
Article 8(1) of the Char ter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Char ter’) and Article 16(1) of the
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that ever yone has the right to the prot ection of
personal data concer ning him or her.
(2) The principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal
data should, whate ver their nationality or residence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular
their right to the prote ction of personal data. This Regulation is intended to contr ibute to the accompl ishment of
an area of freedom, secur ity and justice and of an economic union, to economic and social progress, to the
strengthening and the converg ence of the economies within the internal mark et, and to the well-being of natural
persons.
(3) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) seeks to harmonise the prot ection of
fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in respect of processing activities and to ensure the free flow
of personal data between Member State s. 4.5.2016 L 119/1 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

reading of 8 Apr il 2016 (not yet published in the Offi cial Jour nal). Position of the European Parliament of 14 Apr il 2016.
(4)Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to
the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31).

(4) The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the prote ction of personal
data is not an absolute right ; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against
other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of propor tionality . This Regulation respects all
fundamental rights and obser ves the freedoms and principles recognised in the Char ter as enshr ined in the
Treaties, in particular the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of
personal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to
conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic
diversity .
(5) The economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the intern al mark et has led to a substantial
increase in cross-border flows of personal data. The exchange of personal data between public and private actor s,
including natural persons, associations and under takings across the Union has increased. National author ities in
the Member State s are being called upon by Union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able
to perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an author ity in another Member State .
(6) Rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal
data. The scale of the collection and shar ing of personal data has increased signif icantly . Techn ology allows both
private companies and public author ities to mak e use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to
pursue their activities. Natural persons increasing ly mak e personal information available publicly and globally .
Technology has transf ormed both the econom y and social life, and should further facilitat e the free flow of
personal data within the Union and the transfer to third countr ies and international orga nisations, while ensur ing
a high level of the protection of personal data.
(7) Those developments require a strong and more coherent data prot ection framew ork in the Union, back ed by
strong enforcement, given the impor tance of creating the trust that will allow the digital econom y to develop
across the internal mark et. Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical
certainty for natural persons, economic operat ors and public author ities should be enhanced.
(8) Where this Regulation provides for specific ations or restr ictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States
may, as far as necessar y for coherence and for making the national provisions compreh ensible to the persons to
whom they apply , incor porate elements of this Regulation into their national law.
(9) The objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevente d fragmentation in the
implementation of data protection across the Union, legal uncer tainty or a widespread public percep tion that
there are signif icant risks to the protection of natural persons, in particular with regar d to online activity .
Differences in the level of prote ction of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the
prot ection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the
free flow of personal data throughout the Union. Those diffe rences may theref ore constitute an obstacle to the
pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distor t competition and impede author ities in the
disc harge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such a differ ence in levels of protection is due to the
existen ce of differ ences in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC.
(10) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of prot ection of natural persons and to remo ve the obstacles to
flows of personal data within the Union, the level of prot ection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons
with regar d to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consisten t and
homog enous application of the rules for the prote ction of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural
persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the
processing of personal data for compl iance with a legal oblig ation, for the performa nce of a task carried out in
the public interest or in the exer cise of offici al author ity vested in the controller , Member States should be
allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this
Regulation. In conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing Directive
95/46/EC, Member State s have several sector-specif ic laws in areas that need more specifi c provisions. This
Regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the
processing of special categor ies of personal data (‘sensitive data’). To that exte nt, this Regulation does not excl ude
Member State law that sets out the circumstances for specifi c processing situations, including determining more
precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful. 4.5.2016 L 119/2 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

(11) Effective prote ction of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of
the rights of data subjects and the oblig ations of those who process and determine the processing of personal
data, as well as equivalent powers for monitori ng and ensur ing compl iance with the rules for the prote ction of
personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the Member States.
(12) Article 16(2) TFEU mandates the European Parliament and the Council to lay down the rules relating to the
prot ection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating to the free
movement of personal data.
(13) In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent
diverg ences hamp ering the free movement of personal data within the internal mark et, a Regulation is necessar y
to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operat ors, including micro, small and medium-sized
enterprises, and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of lega lly enforceable rights
and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the
processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation
between the super visor y author ities of diffe rent Member States. The proper functioning of the internal mark et
requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not restr icted or prohibit ed for reasons
connecte d with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account
of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derog ation for
organisations with fewer than 250 emplo yees with regar d to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions
and bodies, and Member States and their super visor y author ities, are encourag ed to take account of the specifi c
needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterpr ises in the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro,
small and medium-sized enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation
2003/361/EC (1).
(14) The protection afforded by this Regulation should apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of
residence, in relation to the processing of their personal data. This Regulation does not cover the processing of
personal data which concer ns legal persons and in particular under takings established as legal persons, including
the name and the form of the legal person and the contact details of the legal person.
(15) In order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention, the prote ction of natural persons should be technolo ­
gically neutral and should not depend on the techniques used. The prot ection of natural persons should apply to
the processing of personal data by automat ed means, as well as to manual processing, if the personal data are
contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system. Files or sets of files, as well as their cover pages,
whic h are not structured according to specifi c criteria should not fall within the scope of this Regulation.
(16) This Regulation does not apply to issues of prot ection of fundamental rights and freedoms or the free flow of
personal data relat ed to activities whic h fall outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concer ning national
secur ity. This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying
out activities in relation to the common foreign and secur ity policy of the Union.
(17) Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) applies to the processing of
personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and other
Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal data should be adapt ed to the principles and rules
established in this Regulation and applied in the light of this Regulation. In order to provide a strong and
coherent data prote ction framework in the Union, the necessar y adapta tions of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001
should follow after the adoptio n of this Regulation, in order to allow application at the same time as this
Regulation.
(18) This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person in the course of a purely
personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity . Personal or 4.5.2016 L 119/3 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

12.1.2001, p. 1).

household activities could include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social netw orking and online
activity under taken within the cont ext of such activities. However , this Regulation applies to controllers or
processors which provide the means for processing personal data for such personal or household activities.
(19) The protect ion of natural persons with regar d to the processing of personal data by compet ent author ities for the
purposes of the prevention, investig ation, detec tion or prosecution of criminal offences or the executi on of
criminal penalties, including the safeg uarding against and the prevention of threats to public secur ity and the free
movement of such data, is the subject of a specific Union legal act. This Regulation should not, theref ore, apply
to processing activities for those purposes. However , personal data processed by public author ities under this
Regulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more specific Union legal act, namely
Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). Member States may entr ust
compet ent author ities within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessar ily
carried out for the purposes of the prevention, inve stigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the
executi on of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public secur ity, so
that the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is within the scope of Union law,
falls within the scope of this Regulation.
With regard to the processing of personal data by those compet ent author ities for purposes falling within scope
of this Regulation, Member States should be able to maintain or introduce more specifi c provisions to adapt the
application of the rules of this Regulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements
for the processing of personal data by those compet ent author ities for those other purposes, taking into account
the constitutional, organisational and administrative structure of the respective Member State . When the
processing of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation, this Regulation should
provide for the possibility for Member States under specifi c conditions to restr ict by law certain oblig ations and
rights when such a restr iction constitute s a necessar y and propor tionat e measure in a democratic society to
safeg uard specific important interests including public secur ity and the prevention, investigation, detection or
prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the
prevention of threats to public secur ity. This is relevant for instance in the framework of anti-money launder ing
or the activities of forensic laboratori es.
(20) While this Regulation applies, inter alia, to the activities of cour ts and other judicial author ities, Union or
Member State law could specify the processing operations and processing procedures in relation to the
processing of personal data by cour ts and other judicial author ities. The compe tence of the super visor y
author ities should not cover the processing of personal data when cour ts are acting in their judicial capacity , in
order to safeg uard the independence of the judiciar y in the performa nce of its judicial tasks, including decision-
making. It should be possible to entr ust super vision of such data processing operations to specific bodies within
the judicial system of the Member State , which should, in particular ensure compl iance with the rules of this
Regulation, enhance awar eness among members of the judiciar y of their oblig ations under this Regulation and
handle compl aints in relation to such data processing operations.
(21) This Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and
of the Council (2), in particular of the liability rules of interm ediar y service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that
Directive. That Directive seeks to contr ibute to the proper functioning of the internal mark et by ensur ing the free
movement of information society services between Member States.
(22) Any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor
in the Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regar dless of whether the processing itself
take s place within the Union. Establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable
arrang ements. The legal form of such arrang ements, whether through a branch or a subsidiar y with a legal
personality , is not the deter mining factor in that respect. 4.5.2016 L 119/4 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

(23) In order to ensure that natural persons are not depr ived of the protection to which they are entitled under this
Regulation, the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor
not established in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities are related to
offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connect ed to a payment. In order to
determine whether such a controller or processor is offer ing goods or services to data subjects who are in the
Union, it should be ascer tained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offer ing services
to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's,
processor's or an interm ediar y's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use
of a language generally used in the third countr y where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascer tain
such intenti on, factors such as the use of a language or a currency general ly used in one or more Member States
with the possibility of order ing goods and services in that other languag e, or the mentioning of custome rs or
users who are in the Union, may make it apparent that the controller envisages offer ing goods or services to data
subjects in the Union.
(24) The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not
established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitori ng of the
beha viour of such data subjects in so far as their behavi our takes place within the Union. In order to determine
whether a processing activity can be considered to monit or the beha viour of data subjects, it should be
ascer tained whether natural persons are tracked on the intern et including potential subsequent use of personal
data processing techniques which consist of prof iling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions
concer ning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, beha viours and attitudes.
(25) Where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation should also apply to a
controller not established in the Union, such as in a Member State 's diplomatic mission or consular post.
(26) The principles of data prote ction should apply to any information concer ning an identif ied or identifiable natural
person. Personal data which have undergone pseudon ymisation, whic h could be attributed to a natural person by
the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identif iable natural person. To
determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to
be used, such as sing ling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly
or indirectly . To ascer tain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account
should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identif ication,
taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments.
The principles of data protection should theref ore not apply to anonymous information, namely information
whic h does not relate to an identified or identif iable natural person or to personal data rendered anonym ous in
such a manner that the data subject is not or no long er identifiable. This Regulation does not theref ore concer n
the processing of such anony mous information, including for statistical or research purposes.
(27) This Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Member States may provide for rules
regar ding the processing of personal data of deceased persons.
(28) The application of pseudonymisation to personal data can reduce the risks to the data subjects concer ned and
help controllers and processors to meet their data-protection oblig ations. The explicit introduction of ‘pseudon y­
misation’ in this Regulation is not intended to preclude any other measures of data prote ction.
(29) In order to creat e incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudony mi­
sation should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller when that controller has
take n technical and organisational measures necessar y to ensure, for the processing concer ned, that this
Regulation is implement ed, and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specifi c data
subject is kept separately . The controller processing the personal data should indicate the author ised persons
within the same controller . 4.5.2016 L 119/5 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

(30) Natural persons may be associated with online identif iers provided by their devices, applications, tools and
prot ocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identif iers or other identif iers such as radio frequency
identification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other
information received by the servers, may be used to creat e profiles of the natural persons and identify them.
(31) Public author ities to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal oblig ation for the exer cise of
their official mission, such as tax and customs author ities, financial investig ation units, independent adminis ­
trative author ities, or financial mark et author ities responsible for the regulation and super vision of secur ities
mark ets should not be regar ded as recipients if they receive personal data whic h are necessar y to carry out a
particular inquir y in the general inter est, in accordance with Union or Member State law. The requests for
disclosure sent by the public author ities should alwa ys be in writing, reasoned and occasional and should not
concer n the entirety of a filing system or lead to the interconnection of filing systems. The processing of personal
data by those public author ities should compl y with the applicable data-protection rules according to the
purposes of the processing.
(32) Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specifi c, informed and
unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her,
such as by a written state ment, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a
box when visiting an intern et website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another
statement or conduct whic h clearly indicates in this conte xt the data subject's accept ance of the proposed
processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-tick ed boxes or inactivity should not theref ore constitute
consent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the
processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be
given following a request by electronic means, the request must be clear , concise and not unnecessar ily disrupti ve
to the use of the service for which it is provided.
(33) It is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientifi c researc h purposes at
the time of data collection. Theref ore, data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of
scientific researc h when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects should
have the oppor tunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects to the
exte nt allowed by the intende d purpose.
(34) Genetic data should be defined as personal data relating to the inher ited or acquired genetic charact eristics of a
natural person whic h result from the analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question, in
particular chromosomal, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the analysis of
another element enabling equivalent information to be obtained.
(35) Personal data concer ning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which
reveal information relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject. This
includes information about the natural person collect ed in the course of the registration for, or the provision of,
health care services as refer red to in Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) to
that natural person; a number , symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify the natural
person for health purposes; information derived from the testing or examination of a body part or bodily
substance, including from genetic data and biological sam ples; and any information on, for example, a disease,
disability , disease risk, medical histo ry, clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical state of the data
subject independent of its source, for example from a physician or other health profess ional, a hospital, a medical
device or an in vitro diagnostic test.
(36) The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be the place of its central administration in the
Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another
establishment of the controller in the Union, in whic h case that other establishment should be considered to be 4.5.2016 L 119/6 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN
(1)Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients' rights in
cross‑border healthcare (OJ L 88, 4.4.2011, p. 45).

*Page 7*

the main establishment. The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be determined according to
objective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of manag ement activities determi ning the main
decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable arrangements. That criterion should not
depend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of
technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not, in themselves,
constitut e a main establishment and are theref ore not determining criteria for a main establishment. The main
establishment of the processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or, if it has no
central administration in the Union, the place where the main processing activities take place in the Union. In
cases involving both the controller and the processor , the compe tent lead super visor y author ity should remain
the super visor y author ity of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment, but the
super visor y author ity of the processor should be considered to be a super visor y author ity concer ned and that
super visor y author ity should participate in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any
case, the super visor y author ities of the Member State or Member States where the processor has one or more
establishments should not be considered to be super visor y author ities concer ned where the draf t decision
concer ns only the controller . Where the processing is carried out by a group of under takings, the main
establishment of the controlling under taking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group of
under takings, excep t where the purposes and means of processing are deter mined by another under taking.
(37) A group of under takings should cover a controlling under taking and its controlled under takings, whereby the
controlling under taking should be the under taking which can exer t a dominant influence over the other
under takings by virtue, for example, of ownership, financial participation or the rules which govern it or the
power to have personal data prote ction rules implemented. An under taking which controls the processing of
personal data in under takings affiliated to it should be regarded, together with those under takings, as a group of
under takings.
(38) Children mer it specific protection with rega rd to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks,
consequences and safeg uards concer ned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data. Such
specific protection should, in particular , apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of
mark eting or creating personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children
when using services offered directly to a child. The consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be
necessar y in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child.
(39) Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons that
personal data concer ning them are collect ed, used, consulte d or other wise processed and to what extent the
personal data are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any information and communi ­
cation relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear
and plain language be used. That principle concer ns, in particular , information to the data subjects on the
identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and
transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concer ned and their right to obtain conf irmation and
communication of personal data concer ning them whic h are being processed. Natural persons should be made
awar e of risks, rules, safeg uards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exer cise their
rights in relation to such processing. In particular , the specific purposes for which personal data are processed
should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data. The personal
data should be adequate, relevant and limite d to what is necessar y for the purposes for whic h they are processed.
This requires, in particular , ensur ing that the period for whic h the personal data are stored is limited to a strict
minimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be
fulfilled by other means. In order to ensure that the personal data are not kept longer than necessar y, time limits
should be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review . Ever y reasonable step should be take n
to ensure that personal data which are inaccurat e are rectified or deleted. Personal data should be processed in a
manner that ensures appropr iate secur ity and conf identiality of the personal data, including for preventing
unauthor ised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing.
(40) In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data
subject concer ned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or 4.5.2016 L 119/7 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

*Page 8*

Member State law as refer red to in this Regulation, including the necessity for compl iance with the legal
oblig ation to which the controller is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data
subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
(41) Where this Regulation refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessar ily require a legislative
act adopt ed by a parliament, without prejudice to requirements pursuant to the constitutional order of the
Member State concer ned. However , such a lega l basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its
application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with the case-law of the Cour t of Justice
of the European Union (the ‘Cour t of Justice’) and the European Cour t of Human Rights.
(42) Where processing is based on the data subject's consent, the controller should be able to demonstrate that the
data subject has given consent to the processing operation. In particular in the context of a written declaration
on another matt er, safeg uards should ensure that the data subject is awar e of the fact that and the extent to
whic h consent is given. In accordance with Council Directive 93/13/EEC (1) a declaration of consent pre-
formulate d by the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain
languag e and it should not contain unfair terms. For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at
least of the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are
intende d. Consent should not be regar ded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is
unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detr iment.
(43) In order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing
of personal data in a specifi c case where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller , in
particular where the controller is a public author ity and it is theref ore unlikely that consent was freely given in
all the circumstances of that specifi c situation. Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow
separate consent to be given to differ ent personal data processing operations despit e it being appropr iate in the
individual case, or if the perf ormance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the
consent despite such consent not being necessar y for such performa nce.
(44) Processing should be lawful where it is necessar y in the cont ext of a contract or the intention to enter into a
contract.
(45) Where processing is carried out in accordance with a legal oblig ation to whic h the controller is subject or where
processing is necessar y for the performa nce of a task carried out in the public inter est or in the exer cise of
official author ity, the processing should have a basis in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not
require a specific law for each individual processing. A law as a basis for several processing operations based on a
legal oblig ation to whic h the controller is subject or where processing is necessar y for the perf ormance of a task
carried out in the public interest or in the exer cise of an official author ity may be sufficient. It should also be for
Union or Member State law to determine the purpose of processing. Further more, that law could specify the
general conditions of this Regulation governing the lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specif ications
for determining the controller , the type of personal data whic h are subject to the processing, the data subjects
concer ned, the entities to which the personal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storag e period
and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing. It should also be for Union or Member State law to
determine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exer cise of official
author ity should be a public author ity or another natural or legal person governed by public law, or, where it is
in the public inter est to do so, including for health purposes such as public health and social protection and the
manag ement of health care services, by private law, such as a professional association.
(46) The processing of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessar y to prote ct an inter est
whic h is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. Processing of personal data 4.5.2016 L 119/8 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

based on the vital inter est of another natural person should in principle take place only where the processing
cannot be manifest ly based on another legal basis. Some types of processing may serve both impor tant grounds
of public interest and the vital inter ests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessar y for
humanitar ian purposes, including for monitori ng epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitar ian
emerg encies, in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters.
(47) The legitimate inter ests of a controller , including those of a controller to which the personal data may be
disclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the
fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable
expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller . Such legitimate interest could exist
for example where there is a relevant and appropr iate relationship between the data subject and the controller in
situations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller . At any rate the existen ce of
a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the
time and in the cont ext of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place.
The inter ests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the inter est of the data
controller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect
further processing. Given that it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public author ities to
process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing by public author ities in the
performa nce of their tasks. The processing of personal data strictly necessar y for the purposes of preventing
fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concer ned. The processing of personal data for
direct mark eting purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate inter est.
(48) Controllers that are part of a group of under takings or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a
legitimate inter est in transmitting personal data within the group of under takings for internal administrative
purposes, including the processing of clients' or employees' personal data. The general principles for the transfe r
of personal data, within a group of under takings, to an under taking locat ed in a third countr y remain unaffect ed.
(49) The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessar y and propor tionate for the purposes of ensur ing
netw ork and information secur ity, i.e. the ability of a network or an information syste m to resist, at a given level
of conf idence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availabi lity, authenticity ,
integrity and confidentiality of store d or transmitte d personal data, and the secur ity of the related services offered
by, or accessible via, those netw orks and systems, by public author ities, by comput er emerge ncy response teams
(CERT s), comput er secur ity incident response teams (CSIRT s), by providers of electronic communications
netw orks and services and by providers of secur ity technologies and services, constitutes a legitimat e interest of
the data controller concer ned. This could, for exam ple, include preventing unauthor ised access to electronic
communications netw orks and malicious code distr ibution and stoppi ng ‘denial of service ’ attacks and damage to
comput er and electronic communication systems.
(50) The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collect ed
should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were
initially collect ed. In such a case, no lega l basis separate from that whic h allowed the collection of the personal
data is required. If the processing is necessar y for the performa nce of a task carried out in the public interest or
in the exer cise of official author ity vested in the controller , Union or Member State law may determine and
specify the tasks and purposes for whic h the further processing should be regar ded as compati ble and lawful.
Further processing for archiv ing purposes in the public inter est, scientific or histor ical researc h purposes or
statistical purposes should be considered to be compati ble lawful processing operations. The legal basis provided
by Union or Member State law for the processing of personal data may also provide a lega l basis for further
processing. In order to ascer tain whether a purpose of further processing is compati ble with the purpose for
whic h the personal data are initially collect ed, the controller , after having met all the requirements for the
lawfulness of the original processing, should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and
the purposes of the intende d further processing; the context in whic h the personal data have been collected, in
particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their 4.5.2016 L 119/9 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

further use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further processing for data
subjects; and the existen ce of appropr iate safeguards in both the original and intended further processing
operations.
Where the data subject has given consent or the processing is based on Union or Member State law which
constitut es a necessar y and propor tionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular , impor tant
objectives of general public interest, the controller should be allowed to further process the personal data
irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes. In any case, the application of the principles set out in this
Regulation and in particular the information of the data subject on those other purposes and on his or her rights
including the right to object, should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal acts or threats to public secur ity by
the controller and transmitting the relevant personal data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the
same criminal act or threats to public secur ity to a compet ent author ity should be regarded as being in the
legitimate interest pursued by the controller . However , such transmission in the legitimate interest of the
controller or further processing of personal data should be prohibit ed if the processing is not compat ible with a
legal, profess ional or other binding oblig ation of secrecy .
(51) Personal data whic h are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms
mer it specific protection as the context of their processing could creat e signif icant risks to the fundamental rights
and freedoms. Those personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, whereby the use
of the term ‘racial origin’ in this Regulation does not imply an acceptance by the Union of theor ies which
attempt to determine the existence of separate human races. The processing of photog raphs should not systemati ­
cally be considered to be processing of special cate gories of personal data as they are covered by the definit ion of
biometr ic data only when processed through a specifi c technical means allowing the unique identif ication or
authentication of a natural person. Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing is allowed in
specific cases set out in this Regulation, taking into account that Member States law may lay down specific
provisions on data protection in order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation for compl iance
with a legal oblig ation or for the performa nce of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
official author ity vested in the controller . In addition to the specific requirements for such processing, the general
principles and other rules of this Regulation should apply , in particular as regar ds the conditions for lawful
processing. Derog ations from the general prohibition for processing such special catego ries of personal data
should be explicitly provided, inter alia, where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect of
specific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course of legitimate activities by certain
associations or foundations the purpose of whic h is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms.
(52) Derog ating from the prohibition on processing special categor ies of personal data should also be allowed when
provided for in Union or Member State law and subject to suitable safeg uards, so as to protect personal data and
other fundamental rights, where it is in the public inter est to do so, in particular processing personal data in the
field of emplo yment law, social protect ion law including pensions and for health secur ity, monitoring and alert
purposes, the prevention or control of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health. Such a
deroga tion may be made for health purposes, including public health and the manag ement of health-care
services, especially in order to ensure the quality and cost-eff ectiveness of the procedures used for settling claims
for benefits and services in the health insurance system , or for archiving purposes in the public inter est, scientifi c
or histor ical research purposes or statistical purposes. A derog ation should also allow the processing of such
personal data where necessar y for the establishment, exercise or defe nce of legal claims, whether in cour t
proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-cour t procedure.
(53) Special cate gories of personal data whic h mer it higher prote ction should be processed for health-related purposes
only where necessar y to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons and society as a whole, in
particular in the context of the management of health or social care services and syste ms, including processing
by the management and central national health author ities of such data for the purpose of quality control,
manag ement information and the general national and local super vision of the health or social care system , and
ensur ing continuity of health or social care and cross-border healthcare or health secur ity, monitori ng and alert
purposes, or for archiving purposes in the public inter est, scientific or histo rical researc h purposes or statistical
purposes, based on Union or Member State law whic h has to meet an objective of public interest, as well as for
studies conduct ed in the public interest in the area of public health. Theref ore, this Regulation should provide for
harmonised conditions for the processing of special categor ies of personal data concer ning health, in respect of
specific needs, in particular where the processing of such data is carried out for certain health-relat ed purposes 4.5.2016 L 119/10 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

*Page 11*

by persons subject to a legal oblig ation of professional secrecy . Union or Member State law should provide for
specific and suitable measures so as to prote ct the fundamental rights and the personal data of natural persons.
Member State s should be allowed to maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations, with rega rd
to the processing of genetic data, biometr ic data or data concer ning health. However , this should not ham per the
free flow of personal data within the Union when those conditions apply to cross-border processing of such data.
(54) The processing of special catego ries of personal data may be necessar y for reasons of public interest in the areas
of public health without consent of the data subject. Such processing should be subject to suitable and specifi c
measures so as to prot ect the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In that context, ‘public health’ should be
interpreted as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1),
namely all elements related to health, namely health status, including morbidity and disability , the determinants
having an effect on that health status, health care needs, resources allocated to health care, the provision of, and
universal access to, health care as well as health care expenditure and financing, and the causes of mor tality . Such
processing of data concer ning health for reasons of public inter est should not result in personal data being
processed for other purposes by third parties such as emplo yers or insurance and banking companies.
(55) Moreo ver, the processing of personal data by official author ities for the purpose of achieving the aims, laid down
by constitutional law or by intern ational public law, of officially recognised religious associations, is carried out
on grounds of public interest.
(56) Where in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system in a Member State requires
that political parties compile personal data on people's political opinions, the processing of such data may be
permitted for reasons of public interest, provided that appropr iate safeg uards are established.
(57) If the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to identify a natural person, the data
controller should not be oblig ed to acquire additional information in order to identify the data subject for the
sole purpose of compl ying with any provision of this Regulation. However , the controller should not refuse to
take additional information provided by the data subject in order to suppor t the exer cise of his or her rights.
Identification should include the digital identif ication of a data subject, for example through authentication
mech anism such as the same credentials, used by the data subject to log-in to the on-line service offered by the
data controller .
(58) The principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject be
concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language and, additionally , where
appropr iate, visualisation be used. Such information could be provided in electronic form, for examp le, when
addressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular relevance in situations where the prolife ration of
actors and the technological complexity of practice make it difficult for the data subject to kno w and understand
whether , by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being collect ed, such as in the
case of online adver tising. Given that children mer it specifi c protection, any information and communication,
where processing is addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the child can easily
understand.
(59) Modalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights under this Regulation,
including mech anisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge, in particular , access to and rectification
or erasure of personal data and the exercise of the right to object. The controller should also provide means for
requests to be made electronically , especially where personal data are processed by electronic means. The
controller should be oblig ed to respond to requests from the data subject without undue dela y and at the latest
within one month and to give reasons where the controller does not intend to compl y with any such requests. 4.5.2016 L 119/11 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

health and health and safety at work (OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 70).

(60) The principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existen ce of the
processing operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with any further
information necessar y to ensure fair and transparent processing taking into account the specific circumstances
and cont ext in whic h the personal data are processed. Further more, the data subject should be informed of the
existen ce of profiling and the consequences of such prof iling. Where the personal data are collect ed from the
data subject, the data subject should also be informed whether he or she is oblig ed to provide the personal data
and of the consequences, where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided in
combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner , a
meaningful overview of the intende d processing. Where the icons are presented electronically , they should be
machi ne-readable.
(61) The information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be given to him
or her at the time of collection from the data subject, or, where the personal data are obtained from another
source, within a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal data can be
legitimate ly disclosed to another recipient, the data subject should be informed when the personal data are first
disclosed to the recipient. Where the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than that
for whic h they were collected, the controller should provide the data subject prior to that further processing with
information on that other purpose and other necessar y information. Where the origin of the personal data
cannot be provided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general information should be
provided.
(62) However , it is not necessar y to imp ose the oblig ation to provide information where the data subject already
possesses the information, where the recording or disclosure of the personal data is expressly laid down by law
or where the provision of information to the data subject proves to be imp ossible or would involve a dispropor ­
tionate effort. The latter could in particular be the case where processing is carried out for archiving purposes in
the public interest, scientific or histo rical research purposes or statistical purposes. In that regard, the number of
data subjects, the age of the data and any appropr iate safeg uards adopt ed should be take n into consideration.
(63) A data subject should have the right of access to personal data whic h have been collect ed concer ning him or her,
and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable inter vals, in order to be awar e of, and verify, the lawfulness of
the processing. This includes the right for data subjects to have access to data concer ning their health, for
examp le the data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses, examination results,
assessments by treating physicians and any treatment or inter ventions provided. Ever y data subject should
theref ore have the right to kno w and obtain communication in particular with regar d to the purposes for whic h
the personal data are processed, where possible the period for whic h the personal data are processed, the
recipients of the personal data, the logic involved in any autom atic personal data processing and, at least when
based on profiling, the consequences of such processing. Where possible, the controller should be able to provide
remot e access to a secure system which would provide the data subject with direct access to his or her personal
data. That right should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade secrets or intellectual
proper ty and in particular the copyright protecting the software. However , the result of those considerations
should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data subject. Where the controller processes a large
quantity of information concer ning the data subject, the controller should be able to request that, before the
information is delivered, the data subject specify the information or processing activities to whic h the request
relat es.
(64) The controller should use all reasonable measures to verify the identity of a data subject who requests access, in
particular in the conte xt of online services and online identif iers. A controller should not retain personal data for
the sole purpose of being able to react to potential requests.
(65) A data subject should have the right to have personal data concer ning him or her rectified and a ‘right to be
forgotte n’ where the retention of such data infringes this Regulation or Union or Member State law to which the
controller is subject. In particular , a data subject should have the right to have his or her personal data erased
and no longer processed where the personal data are no long er necessar y in relation to the purposes for which
they are collected or other wise processed, where a data subject has withdrawn his or her consent or objects to
the processing of personal data concer ning him or her, or where the processing of his or her personal data does
not other wise compl y with this Regulation. That right is relevant in particular where the data subject has given 4.5.2016 L 119/12 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

---
*Page 13*

his or her consent as a child and is not fully awar e of the risks involved by the processing, and later wants to
remo ve such personal data, especially on the intern et. The data subject should be able to exercise that right
notwithstanding the fact that he or she is no long er a child. However , the further retention of the personal data
should be lawful where it is necessar y, for exercisi ng the right of freedom of expression and information, for
compl iance with a legal oblig ation, for the performa nce of a task carried out in the public inter est or in the
exer cise of official author ity vested in the controller , on the grounds of public inter est in the area of public
health, for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or histo rical research purposes or statistical
purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
(66) To strengthen the right to be forgotten in the online environment, the right to erasure should also be exte nded in
such a way that a controller who has made the personal data public should be oblig ed to inform the controllers
whic h are processing such personal data to erase any links to, or copies or replications of those personal data. In
doing so, that controller should take reasonable step s, taking into account available technology and the means
available to the controller , including technical measures, to inform the controllers which are processing the
personal data of the data subject's request.
(67) Methods by whic h to restr ict the processing of personal data could include, inter alia, temporar ily moving the
select ed data to another processing system, making the selecte d personal data unavai lable to users, or temporar ily
remo ving published data from a website . In autom ated filing syste ms, the restr iction of processing should in
principle be ensured by technical means in such a manner that the personal data are not subject to further
processing operations and cannot be chang ed. The fact that the processing of personal data is restr icted should
be clearly indicated in the system.
(68) To further strengthen the control over his or her own data, where the processing of personal data is carried out
by automat ed means, the data subject should also be allowed to receive personal data concer ning him or her
whic h he or she has provided to a controller in a structured, commonly used, machi ne-readable and inter operable
format, and to transmit it to another controller . Data controllers should be encourag ed to develop interoperable
formats that enable data portability . That right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on
the basis of his or her consent or the processing is necessar y for the performa nce of a contract. It should not
apply where processing is based on a legal ground other than consent or contract. By its very nature, that right
should not be exercised against controllers processing personal data in the exer cise of their public duties. It
should theref ore not apply where the processing of the personal data is necessar y for compl iance with a lega l
oblig ation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public inter est or
in the exer cise of an official author ity vested in the controller . The data subject's right to transmit or receive
personal data concer ning him or her should not creat e an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain
processing systems which are technically compati ble. Where, in a certain set of personal data, more than one
data subject is concer ned, the right to receive the personal data should be without prejudice to the rights and
freedoms of other data subjects in accordance with this Regulation. Further more, that right should not prejudice
the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the limitations of that right as set out in
this Regulation and should, in particular , not imply the erasure of personal data concer ning the data subject
whic h have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the exte nt that and for as long as
the personal data are necessar y for the performa nce of that contract. Where technically feasible, the data subject
should have the right to have the personal data transmitte d directly from one controller to another .
(69) Where personal data might lawfully be processed because processing is necessar y for the performa nce of a task
carried out in the public inter est or in the exercise of official author ity vested in the controller , or on grounds of
the legitimate inter ests of a controller or a third party, a data subject should, never theless, be entitled to object to
the processing of any personal data relating to his or her particular situation. It should be for the controller to
demonstrate that its compelling legitimate inter est overrides the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms
of the data subject.
(70) Where personal data are processed for the purposes of direct mark eting, the data subject should have the right to
object to such processing, including prof iling to the exte nt that it is related to such direct mark eting, whether
with regard to initial or further processing, at any time and free of charge. That right should be explicitly brought
to the attention of the data subject and present ed clearly and separate ly from any other information. 4.5.2016 L 119/13 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

*Page 14*

(71) The data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure, evaluating
personal aspects relating to him or her whic h is based solely on automat ed processing and which produces lega l
effects concer ning him or her or similarly signif icantly affect s him or her, such as automatic refusal of an online
credit application or e-recr uiting practices without any human intervention. Such processing includes ‘profiling’
that consists of any form of automat ed processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating to a
natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concer ning the data subject's performa nce at work,
economic situation, health, personal pref erences or interests, reliability or beha viour , location or movements,
where it produces legal effects concer ning him or her or similarly signif icantly affect s him or her. However ,
decision-making based on such processing, including profiling, should be allowed where expressly author ised by
Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject, including for fraud and tax-evasion monitori ng
and prevention purposes conduct ed in accordance with the regulations, standards and recommendations of
Union institutions or national oversight bodies and to ensure the secur ity and reliability of a service provided by
the controller , or necessar y for the entering or performa nce of a contract between the data subject and a
controller , or when the data subject has given his or her explicit consent. In any case, such processing should be
subject to suitable safeg uards, which should include specific information to the data subject and the right to
obtain human inter vention, to express his or her point of view , to obtain an explanation of the decision reach ed
after such assessment and to challenge the decision. Such measure should not concer n a child.
In order to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject, taking into account the specif ic
circumstances and context in whic h the personal data are processed, the controller should use appropr iate
mathematical or statistical procedures for the prof iling, implement technical and organisational measures
appropr iate to ensure, in particular , that factors whic h result in inaccuracies in personal data are corrected and
the risk of errors is minimised, secure personal data in a manner that takes account of the pote ntial risks
involved for the interests and rights of the data subject and that prevents, inter alia, discr iminato ry effects on
natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religion or beliefs, trade union
membership, genetic or health status or sexual orientation, or that result in measures having such an effect.
Automat ed decision-making and prof iling based on special catego ries of personal data should be allowed only
under specifi c conditions.
(72) Profiling is subject to the rules of this Regulation governing the processing of personal data, such as the legal
grounds for processing or data protection principles. The European Data Protect ion Board established by this
Regulation (the ‘Board’) should be able to issue guidance in that conte xt.
(73) Restr ictions concer ning specifi c principles and the rights of information, access to and rectification or erasure of
personal data, the right to data portability , the right to object, decisions based on profiling, as well as the
communication of a personal data breach to a data subject and certain related oblig ations of the controllers may
be imposed by Union or Member State law, as far as necessar y and propor tionate in a democratic society to
safeg uard public secur ity, including the prot ection of human life especially in response to natural or manmade
disaste rs, the prevention, investig ation and prosecution of criminal offences or the executi on of criminal
penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public secur ity, or of breaches of
ethics for regulated profe ssions, other impor tant objectives of general public inter est of the Union or of a
Member State, in particular an impor tant economic or financial interest of the Union or of a Member State, the
keeping of public register s kept for reasons of general public inter est, further processing of archived personal data
to provide specific information related to the political beha viour under former totalitar ian state regimes or the
prot ection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others, including social protection, public health and
humanitar ian purposes. Those restr ictions should be in accordance with the requirements set out in the Char ter
and in the European Conv ention for the Prote ction of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
(74) The responsibility and liability of the controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller
or on the controller's behalf should be established. In particular , the controller should be obliged to implement
appropr iate and effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compl iance of processing activities with this
Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. Those measures should take into account the nature,
scope, conte xt and purposes of the processing and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. 4.5.2016 L 119/14 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

*Page 15*

(75) The risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood and sever ity, may result from
personal data processing whic h could lead to physical, mater ial or non-materi al damag e, in particular: where the
processing may give rise to discr imination, identity thef t or fraud, financial loss, damage to the reputation, loss of
confidentiality of personal data prot ected by profess ional secrecy , unauthor ised reversal of pseudon ymisation, or
any other significant economic or social disadvantag e; where data subjects might be depr ived of their rights and
freedoms or prevented from exercisi ng control over their personal data; where personal data are processed which
reveal racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, and
the processing of genetic data, data concer ning health or data concer ning sex life or criminal convictions and
offences or relat ed secur ity measures; where personal aspects are evaluated, in particular analysing or predicting
aspects concer ning performa nce at work, economic situation, health, personal pref erences or interests, reliability
or behaviour , location or movements, in order to creat e or use personal prof iles; where personal data of
vulnerable natural persons, in particular of children, are processed; or where processing involves a large amount
of personal data and affects a large number of data subjects.
(76) The likelihood and sever ity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject should be determined by
reference to the nature, scope, cont ext and purposes of the processing. Risk should be evaluated on the basis of
an objective assessment, by which it is established whether data processing operations involve a risk or a high
risk.
(77) Guidance on the implementation of appropr iate measures and on the demonstration of compliance by the
controller or the processor , especially as regards the identif ication of the risk relat ed to the processing, their
assessment in term s of origin, nature, likelihood and sever ity, and the identification of best practices to mitig ate
the risk, could be provided in particular by means of appro ved codes of conduct, appro ved certifications,
guidelines provided by the Board or indications provided by a data protection officer . The Board may also issue
guidelines on processing operations that are considered to be unlikely to result in a high risk to the rights and
freedoms of natural persons and indicate what measures may be suffi cient in such cases to address such risk.
(78) The prote ction of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
require that appropr iate technical and organisational measures be taken to ensure that the requirements of this
Regulation are met. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller should
adopt internal policies and implement measures which meet in particular the principles of data prot ection by
design and data protection by defa ult. Such measures could consist, inter alia, of minimising the processing of
personal data, pseudony mising personal data as soon as possible, transparency with regard to the functions and
processing of personal data, enabling the data subject to monitor the data processing, enabling the controller to
creat e and imp rove secur ity features. When developing, designing, selecting and using applications, services and
products that are based on the processing of personal data or process personal data to fulfil their task, producers
of the products, services and applications should be encourage d to take into account the right to data protection
when developing and designing such products, services and applications and, with due regar d to the state of the
art, to make sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfil their data prot ection oblig ations. The principles
of data prote ction by design and by default should also be take n into consideration in the conte xt of public
tenders.
(79) The protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects as well as the responsibility and liability of controllers
and processors, also in relation to the monit oring by and measures of super visor y author ities, requires a clear
allocation of the responsibilities under this Regulation, including where a controller determines the purposes and
means of the processing jointly with other controllers or where a processing operation is carried out on behalf of
a controller .
(80) Where a controller or a processor not established in the Union is processing personal data of data subjects who
are in the Union whose processing activities are related to the offer ing of goods or services, irrespective of
whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union, or to the monitori ng of
their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union, the controller or the processor should
designat e a representative, unless the processing is occasional, does not include processing, on a large scale, of
special cate gories of personal data or the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and
offences, and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the 4.5.2016 L 119/15 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

nature, cont ext, scope and purposes of the processing or if the controller is a public author ity or body . The rep­
resentative should act on behalf of the controller or the processor and may be addressed by any super visor y
author ity. The representative should be explicitly designat ed by a written mandat e of the controller or of the
processor to act on its behalf with regar d to its oblig ations under this Regulation. The designation of such a rep­
resentative does not affect the responsibility or liability of the controller or of the processor under this
Regulation. Such a representative should perform its tasks according to the mandate received from the controller
or processor , including cooperating with the compet ent super visor y author ities with regar d to any action take n
to ensure compl iance with this Regulation. The designated representative should be subject to enforcement
proceedings in the event of non-com pliance by the controller or processor .
(81) To ensure compl iance with the requirements of this Regulation in respect of the processing to be carried out by
the processor on behalf of the controller , when entr usting a processor with processing activities, the controller
should use only processors providing suffic ient guarant ees, in particular in term s of exper t kno wledge, reliability
and resources, to implement technical and organisational measures which will meet the requirements of this
Regulation, including for the secur ity of processing. The adherence of the processor to an appro ved code of
conduct or an appro ved certificat ion mech anism may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the
oblig ations of the controller . The carrying-out of processing by a processor should be governed by a contract or
other legal act under Union or Member State law, binding the processor to the controller , setting out the subject-
matt er and duration of the processing, the nature and purposes of the processing, the type of personal data and
catego ries of data subjects, taking into account the specifi c task s and responsibilities of the processor in the
cont ext of the processing to be carried out and the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject. The
controller and processor may choose to use an individual contract or standard contractual clauses which are
adopt ed either directly by the Commission or by a super visor y author ity in accordance with the consistency
mech anism and then adopt ed by the Commission. After the completion of the processing on behalf of the
controller , the processor should, at the choice of the controller , retur n or delet e the personal data, unless there is
a requirement to store the personal data under Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject.
(82) In order to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller or processor should maintain records of
processing activities under its responsibility . Each controller and processor should be obliged to cooperat e with
the super visor y author ity and make those records, on request, available to it, so that it might serve for
monitoring those processing operations.
(83) In order to maintain secur ity and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation, the controller or
processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitig ate those risks,
such as encr yption. Those measures should ensure an appropr iate level of secur ity, including confidentiality ,
taking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of
the personal data to be prot ected. In assessing data secur ity risk, consideration should be given to the risks that
are present ed by personal data processing, such as accidental or unlawful destr uction, loss, alter ation,
unauthor ised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitt ed, stored or other wise processed which may in
particular lead to physical, mate rial or non-mate rial damage .
(84) In order to enhance compliance with this Regulation where processing operations are likely to result in a high
risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller should be responsible for the carrying-out of a
data protection impa ct assessment to evaluate, in particular , the origin, nature, particular ity and sever ity of that
risk. The outcome of the assessment should be taken into account when deter mining the appropr iate measures to
be taken in order to demonstrate that the processing of personal data complies with this Regulation. Where a
data-protecti on impact assessment indicates that processing operations involve a high risk whic h the controller
cannot mitigat e by appropr iate measures in terms of available technology and costs of implementation, a
consultation of the super visor y author ity should take place prior to the processing.
(85) A personal data breac h may, if not addressed in an appropr iate and timely manner , result in physical, mater ial or
non-mate rial damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their personal data or limitation of their
rights, discr imination, identity thef t or fraud, financial loss, unauthor ised reversal of pseudony misation, damage
to reputation, loss of conf identiality of personal data prot ected by professiona l secrecy or any other significant
economic or social disadvantag e to the natural person concer ned. Theref ore, as soon as the controller becomes 4.5.2016 L 119/16 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

awar e that a personal data breach has occur red, the controller should notify the personal data breac h to the
super visor y author ity without undue dela y and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become
awar e of it, unless the controller is able to demonstrate, in accordance with the accountability principle, that the
personal data breac h is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where such
notification cannot be achi eved within 72 hours, the reasons for the dela y should accompan y the notification
and information may be provided in phases without undue further dela y.
(86) The controller should communicate to the data subject a personal data breac h, without undue dela y, where that
personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the natural person in order to
allow him or her to take the necessar y precautions. The communication should descr ibe the nature of the
personal data breach as well as recommendations for the natural person concer ned to mitig ate potential adverse
effects. Such communications to data subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close
cooperation with the super visor y author ity, respecting guidance provided by it or by other relevant author ities
such as law-enf orcement author ities. For example, the need to mitigat e an immediat e risk of damage would call
for promp t communication with data subjects whereas the need to implement appropr iate measures against
continuing or similar personal data breac hes may justify more time for communication.
(87) It should be ascer tained whether all appropr iate technological protect ion and organisational measures have been
implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data breach has take n place and to inform prom ptly
the super visor y author ity and the data subject. The fact that the notifi cation was made without undue dela y
should be established taking into account in particular the nature and gravity of the personal data breac h and its
consequences and adverse effects for the data subject. Such notifi cation may result in an inter vention of the
super visor y author ity in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation.
(88) In setting detailed rules concer ning the format and procedures applicable to the notificati on of personal data
breac hes, due consideration should be given to the circumstances of that breac h, including whether or not
personal data had been prot ected by appropr iate technical protection measures, effectively limiting the likelihood
of identity fraud or other forms of misuse. Moreo ver, such rules and procedures should take into account the
legitimate interests of law-enf orcement author ities where early disclosure could unnecessar ily ham per the investi ­
gation of the circumstances of a personal data breac h.
(89) Directive 95/46/EC provided for a general oblig ation to notify the processing of personal data to the super visor y
author ities. While that oblig ation produces administrative and financial burdens, it did not in all cases contr ibut e
to improving the prot ection of personal data. Such indiscr iminate general notificati on oblig ations should
theref ore be abolished, and replaced by effective procedures and mecha nisms whic h focus instead on those types
of processing operations whic h are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons by
virtue of their nature, scope, context and purposes. Such types of processing operations may be those which in,
particular , involve using new technologies, or are of a new kind and where no data prote ction impact assessment
has been carried out before by the controller , or where they become necessar y in the light of the time that has
elapsed since the initial processing.
(90) In such cases, a data protection impact assessment should be carried out by the controller prior to the processing
in order to assess the particular likelihood and sever ity of the high risk, taking into account the nature, scope,
cont ext and purposes of the processing and the sources of the risk. That impact assessment should include, in
particular , the measures, safeguards and mec hanisms envisaged for mitig ating that risk, ensur ing the prote ction of
personal data and demonstrating compl iance with this Regulation.
(91) This should in particular apply to large-scale processing operations which aim to process a considerable amount
of personal data at regional, national or supranational level and whic h could affect a large number of data
subjects and which are likely to result in a high risk, for example, on account of their sensitivity , where in
accordance with the achi eved state of technological kno wledge a new technology is used on a large scale as well
as to other processing operations which result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in
particular where those operations render it more difficult for data subjects to exer cise their rights. A data 4.5.2016 L 119/17 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

*Page 18*

prot ection impact assessment should also be made where personal data are processed for taking decisions
regar ding specifi c natural persons following any systemat ic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating
to natural persons based on profiling those data or following the processing of special categor ies of personal
data, biometr ic data, or data on criminal convictions and offences or relat ed secur ity measures. A data prot ection
impact assessment is equally required for monitori ng publicly accessible areas on a large scale, especially when
using optic-electronic devices or for any other operations where the compet ent super visor y author ity considers
that the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular
because they prevent data subjects from exercising a right or using a service or a contract, or because they are
carried out systematically on a large scale. The processing of personal data should not be considered to be on a
large scale if the processing concer ns personal data from patients or clients by an individual physician, other
health care profess ional or lawye r. In such cases, a data protect ion impact assessment should not be mandat ory.
(92) There are circumstances under which it may be reasonable and economical for the subject of a data protection
impact assessment to be broader than a sing le project, for exam ple where public author ities or bodies intend to
establish a common application or processing platf orm or where several controllers plan to introduce a common
application or processing envi ronment across an industr y sector or segment or for a widely used horizontal
activity .
(93) In the context of the adoptio n of the Member State law on which the performa nce of the tasks of the public
author ity or public body is based and whic h regulate s the specific processing operation or set of operations in
question, Member States may deem it necessar y to carry out such assessment prior to the processing activities.
(94) Where a data prote ction impact assessment indicates that the processing would, in the absence of safeg uards,
secur ity measures and mechanisms to mitig ate the risk, result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
persons and the controller is of the opinion that the risk cannot be mitig ated by reasonable means in term s of
available technologies and costs of implementation, the super visor y author ity should be consult ed prior to the
start of processing activities. Such high risk is likely to result from certain types of processing and the extent and
frequency of processing, whic h may result also in a realisation of damag e or interfe rence with the rights and
freedoms of the natural person. The super visor y author ity should respond to the request for consultation within
a specified period. However , the absence of a reaction of the super visor y author ity within that period should be
without prejudice to any inter vention of the super visor y author ity in accordance with its task s and powers laid
down in this Regulation, including the power to prohibit processing operations. As part of that consultation
process, the outcome of a data prote ction impact assessment carried out with regar d to the processing at issue
may be submitted to the super visor y author ity, in particular the measures envisaged to mitig ate the risk to the
rights and freedoms of natural persons.
(95) The processor should assist the controller , where necessar y and upon request, in ensur ing compl iance with the
oblig ations deriving from the carrying out of data prote ction imp act assessments and from prior consultation of
the super visor y author ity.
(96) A consultation of the super visor y author ity should also take place in the course of the preparation of a legislative
or regulatory measure whic h provides for the processing of personal data, in order to ensure compliance of the
intende d processing with this Regulation and in particular to mitig ate the risk involved for the data subject.
(97) Where the processing is carried out by a public author ity, excep t for cour ts or independent judicial author ities
when acting in their judicial capacity , where, in the private sector, processing is carried out by a controller whose
core activities consist of processing operations that require regular and syste matic monitori ng of the data subjects
on a large scale, or where the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on a large
scale of special categor ies of personal data and data relating to criminal convictions and offences, a person with
exper t kno wledge of data protect ion law and practices should assist the controller or processor to monitor
internal compliance with this Regulation. In the private sector , the core activities of a controller relat e to its
primar y activities and do not relat e to the processing of personal data as ancillar y activities. The necessar y level
of exper t kno wledge should be determined in particular according to the data processing operations carried out 4.5.2016 L 119/18 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

and the protection required for the personal data processed by the controller or the processor . Such data
prot ection office rs, whether or not they are an emplo yee of the controller , should be in a position to perform
their duties and tasks in an independent manner .
(98) Associations or other bodies representing catego ries of controllers or processors should be encourag ed to draw
up codes of conduct, within the limits of this Regulation, so as to facilitate the effective application of this
Regulation, taking account of the specifi c characteri stics of the processing carried out in certain sector s and the
specific needs of micro, small and medium enterprises. In particular , such codes of conduct could calibrate the
oblig ations of controllers and processors, taking into account the risk likely to result from the processing for the
rights and freedoms of natural persons.
(99) When drawing up a code of conduct, or when amending or extending such a code, associations and other bodies
representing catego ries of controllers or processors should consult relevant stakeholders, including data subjects
where feasible, and have regar d to submissions received and views expressed in response to such consultations.
(100) In order to enhance transparency and compliance with this Regulation, the establishment of certification
mech anisms and data prot ection seals and marks should be encourage d, allowing data subjects to quickl y assess
the level of data protect ion of relevant products and services.
(101) Flows of personal data to and from countr ies outside the Union and internati onal organisations are necessar y for
the expansion of intern ational trade and internati onal cooperation. The increase in such flows has raised new
challenges and concer ns with regard to the protection of personal data. However , when personal data are
transferred from the Union to controllers, processors or other recipients in third countr ies or to international
organisations, the level of protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation should not be
under mined, including in cases of onward transfe rs of personal data from the third countr y or international
organisation to controllers, processors in the same or another third countr y or intern ational organisation. In any
event, transfer s to third countr ies and intern ational organisations may only be carried out in full compl iance with
this Regulation. A transfer could take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the
conditions laid down in the provisions of this Regulation relating to the transfer of personal data to third
countr ies or intern ational organisations are compl ied with by the controller or processor .
(102) This Regulation is without prejudice to internati onal agreements concluded between the Union and third
countr ies regulating the transfe r of personal data including appropr iate safeg uards for the data subjects. Member
States may conclude intern ational agreements which involve the transfer of personal data to third countr ies or in­
ternational organisations, as far as such agreements do not affect this Regulation or any other provisions of
Union law and include an appropr iate level of protection for the fundamental rights of the data subjects.
(103) The Commission may decide with effect for the entire Union that a third countr y, a territory or specifi ed sector
within a third countr y, or an internati onal organisation, offers an adequat e level of data prot ection, thus
providing legal certainty and unif ormity throughout the Union as regards the third countr y or internatio nal
organisation which is considered to provide such level of prot ection. In such cases, transfer s of personal data to
that third countr y or internati onal organisation may take place without the need to obtain any further author is­
ation. The Commission may also decide, having given notice and a full statement setting out the reasons to the
third countr y or internati onal organisation, to revok e such a decision.
(104) In line with the fundamental values on which the Union is founded, in particular the prot ection of human rights,
the Commission should, in its assessment of the third countr y, or of a territory or specifi ed sector within a third
countr y, take into account how a particular third countr y respects the rule of law, access to justice as well as in­
ternational human rights norms and standards and its general and sectoral law, including legislation concer ning
public secur ity, defence and national secur ity as well as public order and criminal law. The adop tion of an
adequacy decision with regard to a territory or a specif ied sector in a third countr y should take into account clear
and objective criteria, such as specifi c processing activities and the scope of applicable legal standards and
legislation in force in the third countr y. The third countr y should offer guarantees ensur ing an adequate level of 4.5.2016 L 119/19 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

---
*Page 20*

prot ection essentially equivalent to that ensured within the Union, in particular where personal data are
processed in one or several specific sectors. In particular , the third countr y should ensure effective independent
data protect ion super vision and should provide for cooperation mec hanisms with the Member States' data
prot ection author ities, and the data subjects should be provided with effective and enforceable rights and effective
administrative and judicial redress.
(105) Apar t from the internati onal commitments the third countr y or international organisation has entered into, the
Commission should take account of obligations arising from the third countr y's or internati onal organisation's
participation in multilateral or regional systems in particular in relation to the prote ction of personal data, as
well as the implementation of such oblig ations. In particular , the third countr y's accession to the Council of
Europe Convention of 28 Januar y 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing
of Personal Data and its Additional Protocol should be take n into account. The Commission should consult the
Board when assessing the level of prot ection in third countr ies or internati onal organisations.
(106) The Commission should monitor the functioning of decisions on the level of protection in a third countr y, a
territory or specified sector within a third countr y, or an intern ational organisation, and monitor the functioning
of decisions adopt ed on the basis of Article 25(6) or Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC. In its adequacy
decisions, the Commission should provide for a periodic review mechanism of their functioning. That periodic
review should be conducted in consultation with the third countr y or intern ational organisation in question and
take into account all relevant developments in the third countr y or intern ational organisati on. For the purposes
of monitoring and of carrying out the periodic reviews, the Commission should take into consideration the views
and findings of the European Parliament and of the Council as well as of other relevant bodies and sources. The
Commission should evaluate, within a reasonable time, the functioning of the latter decisions and repor t any
relevant findings to the Committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European
Parliament and of the Council (1) as established under this Regulation, to the European Parliament and to the
Council.
(107) The Commission may recognise that a third countr y, a territory or a specif ied sector within a third countr y, or an
international organisation no long er ensures an adequate level of data prote ction. Consequently the transfer of
personal data to that third countr y or intern ational organisation should be prohibit ed, unless the requirements in
this Regulation relating to transfers subject to appropr iate safeg uards, including binding corporate rules, and
deroga tions for specifi c situations are fulfilled. In that case, provision should be made for consultations between
the Commission and such third countr ies or international organisations. The Commission should, in a timely
manner , inform the third countr y or international organisation of the reasons and enter into consultations with it
in order to remedy the situation.
(108) In the absence of an adequacy decision, the controller or processor should take measures to compensat e for the
lack of data protection in a third countr y by way of appropr iate safeg uards for the data subject. Such appropr iate
safeg uards may consist of making use of binding corporat e rules, standard data protection clauses adop ted by the
Commission, standard data protection clauses adopt ed by a super visor y author ity or contractual clauses
author ised by a super visor y author ity. Those safeg uards should ensure compl iance with data protection
requirements and the rights of the data subjects appropr iate to processing within the Union, including the
availability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies, including to obtain effective adminis ­
trative or judicial redress and to claim compensation, in the Union or in a third countr y. They should relate in
particular to compliance with the general principles relating to personal data processing, the principles of data
prot ection by design and by default. Transf ers may also be carried out by public author ities or bodies with public
author ities or bodies in third countr ies or with internati onal organisations with corresponding duties or
functions, including on the basis of provisions to be inser ted into administrative arrange ments, such as a
memorandum of understanding, providing for enforceable and effective rights for data subjects. Author isation by
the compet ent super visor y author ity should be obtained when the safeguards are provided for in administrative
arrang ements that are not legally binding.
(109) The possibility for the controller or processor to use standard data-protection clauses adopt ed by the
Commission or by a super visor y author ity should prevent controllers or processors neither from including the 4.5.2016 L 119/20 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN
(1)Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 Febr uary 2011 laying down the rules and general
principles concer ning mec hanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implem enting powers (OJ L 55,
28.2.2011, p. 13).

*Page 21*

standard data-protecti on clauses in a wider contract, such as a contract between the processor and another
processor , nor from adding other clauses or additional safeguards provided that they do not contradict, directly
or indirectly , the standard contractual clauses adop ted by the Commission or by a super visor y author ity or
prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of the data subjects. Controllers and processors should be
encourag ed to provide additional safeguards via contractual commitments that supplement standard protection
clauses.
(110) A group of under takings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity , should be able to make
use of appro ved binding corporate rules for its international transfers from the Union to orga nisations within the
same group of under takings, or group of enterprises engag ed in a joint economic activity , provided that such
corporate rules include all essential principles and enforceable rights to ensure appropr iate safeg uards for
transfer s or categor ies of transfers of personal data.
(111) Provisions should be made for the possibility for transfer s in certain circumstances where the data subject has
given his or her explicit consent, where the transfe r is occasional and necessar y in relation to a contract or a legal
claim, regardless of whether in a judicial procedure or whether in an administrative or any out-of-cour t
procedure, including procedures before regulator y bodies. Provision should also be made for the possibility for
transfer s where imp ortant grounds of public interest laid down by Union or Member State law so require or
where the transfer is made from a register established by law and intended for consultation by the public or
persons having a legitimate inter est. In the latter case, such a transfer should not involve the entirety of the
personal data or entire cate gories of the data contained in the registe r and, when the register is intended for
consultation by persons having a legitimate inter est, the transfer should be made only at the request of those
persons or, if they are to be the recipients, taking into full account the inter ests and fundamental rights of the
data subject.
(112) Those derogations should in particular apply to data transfers required and necessar y for imp ortant reasons of
public interest, for example in cases of international data exchange between competiti on author ities, tax or
customs administrations, between financial super visor y author ities, between services compet ent for social secur ity
matt ers, or for public health, for example in the case of contact tracing for contagious diseases or in order to
reduce and/or eliminate doping in spor t. A transfer of personal data should also be regarded as lawful where it is
necessar y to protect an interest whic h is essential for the data subject's or another person's vital interests,
including physical integrity or life, if the data subject is incapable of giving consent. In the absence of an
adequacy decision, Union or Member State law may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly set limits
to the transfer of specific categor ies of data to a third countr y or an international organisation. Member States
should notify such provisions to the Commission. Any transfer to an internatio nal humanitar ian organisation of
personal data of a data subject who is physically or legally incapable of giving consent, with a view to
accompl ishing a task incumbent under the Geneva Conventions or to compl ying with international humanitar ian
law applicable in armed conf licts, could be considered to be necessar y for an impor tant reason of public inter est
or because it is in the vital interest of the data subject.
(113) Transf ers which can be qualified as not repetitive and that only concer n a limite d number of data subjects, could
also be possible for the purposes of the compelling legitimat e interests pursued by the controller , when those
inter ests are not overridden by the inter ests or rights and freedoms of the data subject and when the controller
has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer . The controller should give particular considera ­
tion to the nature of the personal data, the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or
operations, as well as the situation in the countr y of origin, the third countr y and the countr y of final
destination, and should provide suitable safeg uards to prot ect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural
persons with regard to the processing of their personal data. Such transfer s should be possible only in residual
cases where none of the other grounds for transfer are applicable. For scientific or histo rical research purposes or
statistical purposes, the legitimat e expectations of society for an increase of kno wledge should be taken into con­
sideration. The controller should inform the super visor y author ity and the data subject about the transfer .
(114) In any case, where the Commission has taken no decision on the adequate level of data prot ection in a third
countr y, the controller or processor should make use of solutions that provide data subjects with enforceable and
effective rights as regards the processing of their data in the Union once those data have been transfe rred so that
that they will continue to benefit from fundamental rights and safeguards. 4.5.2016 L 119/21 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

(115) Some third countr ies adopt laws, regulations and other legal acts which purport to directly regulate the
processing activities of natural and legal persons under the jurisdiction of the Member States. This may include
judgments of cour ts or tribunals or decisions of administrative author ities in third countr ies requir ing a
controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data, and which are not based on an international
agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty , in force between the requesting third countr y and the Union
or a Member State. The extrat erritorial application of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in
breac h of internatio nal law and may impede the attainment of the protect ion of natural persons ensured in the
Union by this Regulation. Transf ers should only be allowed where the conditions of this Regulation for a transfer
to third countr ies are met. This may be the case, inter alia, where disclosure is necessar y for an impor tant ground
of public interest recognised in Union or Member State law to whic h the controller is subject.
(116) When personal data moves across borders outside the Union it may put at increased risk the ability of natural
persons to exer cise data prote ction rights in particular to protect themselves from the unlawful use or disclosure
of that information. At the same time, super visor y author ities may find that they are unable to pursue
compl aints or conduct investig ations relating to the activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together
in the cross-border conte xt may also be ham pered by insuffi cient preventative or remedial powers, inconsistent
legal regimes, and practical obstacles like resource constraints. Theref ore, there is a need to promote closer
cooperation among data prot ection super visor y author ities to help them exchang e information and carry out
investigations with their intern ational counter parts. For the purposes of developing internati onal cooperation
mech anisms to facilitat e and provide international mutual assistance for the enforcement of legislation for the
prot ection of personal data, the Commission and the super visor y author ities should exchange information and
cooperat e in activities relat ed to the exercise of their powers with compet ent author ities in third countr ies, based
on reciprocity and in accordance with this Regulation.
(117) The establishment of super visor y author ities in Member States, empo wered to perform their task s and exer cise
their powers with complet e independence, is an essential compo nent of the prote ction of natural persons with
regar d to the processing of their personal data. Member States should be able to establish more than one
super visor y author ity, to reflect their constitutional, organisational and administrative structure.
(118) The independence of super visor y author ities should not mean that the super visor y author ities cannot be subject
to control or monitoring mechanis ms regar ding their financial expenditure or to judicial review .
(119) Where a Member State establishes several super visor y author ities, it should establish by law mech anisms for
ensur ing the effective participation of those super visor y author ities in the consiste ncy mechanism. That Member
State should in particular designat e the super visor y author ity which functions as a sing le contact point for the
effective participation of those author ities in the mechani sm, to ensure swif t and smooth cooperation with other
super visor y author ities, the Board and the Commission.
(120) Each super visor y author ity should be provided with the financial and human resources, premises and
infrastr ucture necessar y for the effective performa nce of their tasks, including those relat ed to mutual assistance
and cooperation with other super visor y author ities throughout the Union. Each super visor y author ity should
have a separate, public annual budget, whic h may be part of the overall state or national budget.
(121) The general conditions for the member or members of the super visor y author ity should be laid down by law in
each Member State and should in particular provide that those members are to be appointed, by means of a
transparent procedure, either by the parliament, government or the head of State of the Member State on the
basis of a proposal from the government, a member of the government, the parliament or a chamber of the
parliament, or by an independent body entr uste d under Member State law. In order to ensure the independence
of the super visor y author ity, the member or members should act with integrity, refrain from any action that is
incompati ble with their duties and should not, during their term of office, engag e in any incompati ble
occupation, whether gainful or not. The super visor y author ity should have its own staff, chosen by the
super visor y author ity or an independent body established by Member State law, which should be subject to the
excl usive direction of the member or members of the super visor y author ity.
(122) Each super visor y author ity should be compet ent on the territory of its own Member State to exercise the powers
and to perform the tasks conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation. This should cover in particular the 4.5.2016 L 119/22 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

processing in the cont ext of the activities of an establishment of the controller or processor on the territory of its
own Member State, the processing of personal data carried out by public author ities or private bodies acting in
the public inter est, processing affectin g data subjects on its territory or processing carried out by a controller or
processor not established in the Union when target ing data subjects residing on its territory . This should include
handling compl aints lodg ed by a data subject, conducting investigat ions on the application of this Regulation and
promoting public aware ness of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal
data.
(123) The super visor y author ities should monit or the application of the provisions pursuant to this Regulation and
contr ibute to its consiste nt application throughout the Union, in order to protect natural persons in relation to
the processing of their personal data and to facilitat e the free flow of personal data within the internal mark et.
For that purpose, the super visor y author ities should cooperate with each other and with the Commission,
without the need for any agreement between Member State s on the provision of mutual assistance or on such
cooperation.
(124) Where the processing of personal data takes place in the cont ext of the activities of an establishment of a
controller or a processor in the Union and the controller or processor is established in more than one
Member State, or where processing taking place in the conte xt of the activities of a sing le establishment of a
controller or processor in the Union substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect data subjects in more
than one Member State, the super visor y author ity for the main establishment of the controller or processor or
for the sing le establishment of the controller or processor should act as lead author ity. It should cooperat e with
the other author ities concer ned, because the controller or processor has an establishment on the territory of their
Member State, because data subjects residing on their territory are substantially affected, or because a compl aint
has been lodg ed with them. Also where a data subject not residing in that Member State has lodge d a complaint,
the super visor y author ity with whic h such compl aint has been lodge d should also be a super visor y author ity
concer ned. Within its task s to issue guidelines on any question covering the application of this Regulation, the
Board should be able to issue guidelines in particular on the criteria to be take n into account in order to
ascer tain whether the processing in question substantially affects data subjects in more than one Member State
and on what constitutes a relevant and reasoned objection.
(125) The lead author ity should be compet ent to adopt binding decisions regarding measures applying the powers
conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation. In its capacity as lead author ity, the super visor y author ity
should closely involve and coordinat e the super visor y author ities concer ned in the decision-making process.
Where the decision is to reject the compl aint by the data subject in whole or in part, that decision should be
adopt ed by the super visor y author ity with whic h the compl aint has been lodg ed.
(126) The decision should be agreed jointly by the lead super visor y author ity and the super visor y author ities concer ned
and should be directe d towards the main or sing le establishment of the controller or processor and be binding on
the controller and processor . The controller or processor should take the necessar y measures to ensure
compl iance with this Regulation and the implementation of the decision notified by the lead super visor y
author ity to the main establishment of the controller or processor as regards the processing activities in the
Union.
(127) Each super visor y author ity not acting as the lead super visor y author ity should be compet ent to handle local
cases where the controller or processor is established in more than one Member State, but the subject matt er of
the specif ic processing concer ns only processing carried out in a sing le Member State and involves only data
subjects in that sing le Member State, for example, where the subject matte r concer ns the processing of emplo yees'
personal data in the specific employment cont ext of a Member State. In such cases, the super visor y author ity
should inform the lead super visor y author ity without dela y about the matt er. After being informed, the lead
super visor y author ity should decide, whether it will handle the case pursuant to the provision on cooperation
between the lead super visor y author ity and other super visor y author ities concer ned (‘one-stop-sh op mechanism’),
or whether the super visor y author ity which informed it should handle the case at local level. When deciding
whether it will handle the case, the lead super visor y author ity should take into account whether there is an
establishment of the controller or processor in the Member State of the super visor y author ity which informed it
in order to ensure effective enforcement of a decision vis-à-vis the controller or processor . Where the lead
super visor y author ity decides to handle the case, the super visor y author ity whic h informed it should have the 4.5.2016 L 119/23 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

---
*Page 24*

possibility to submit a draf t for a decision, of whic h the lead super visor y author ity should take utmost account
when prepar ing its draf t decision in that one-stop-sho p mechanis m.
(128) The rules on the lead super visor y author ity and the one-stop-sho p mech anism should not apply where the
processing is carried out by public author ities or private bodies in the public inter est. In such cases the only
super visor y author ity compet ent to exercise the powers conferr ed to it in accordance with this Regulation should
be the super visor y author ity of the Member State where the public author ity or private body is established.
(129) In order to ensure consiste nt monitori ng and enforcement of this Regulation throughout the Union, the
super visor y author ities should have in each Member State the same tasks and effective powers, including powers
of inve stigation, corrective powers and sanctions, and author isation and advisor y powers, in particular in cases of
compl aints from natural persons, and without prejudice to the powers of prosecutor ial author ities under
Member State law, to bring infringements of this Regulation to the attention of the judicial author ities and
engag e in legal proceedings. Such powers should also include the power to impos e a temporar y or definitive
limitation, including a ban, on processing. Member States may specify other tasks related to the protection of
personal data under this Regulation. The powers of super visor y author ities should be exercised in accordance
with appropr iate procedural safeg uards set out in Union and Member State law, impartially , fairly and within a
reasonable time. In particular each measure should be appropr iate, necessar y and propor tionate in view of
ensur ing compl iance with this Regulation, taking into account the circumstances of each individual case, respect
the right of ever y person to be heard before any individual measure whic h would affect him or her adversely is
take n and avoid superf luous costs and exces sive incon veniences for the persons concer ned. Investig ator y powers
as regar ds access to premises should be exercised in accordance with specif ic requirements in Member State
procedural law, such as the requirement to obtain a prior judicial author isation. Each legally binding measure of
the super visor y author ity should be in writing, be clear and unambiguous, indicate the super visor y author ity
whic h has issued the measure, the date of issue of the measure, bear the signature of the head, or a member of
the super visor y author ity author ised by him or her, give the reasons for the measure, and refer to the right of an
effective remedy . This should not preclude additional requirements pursuant to Member State procedural law. The
adopt ion of a legally binding decision implies that it may give rise to judicial review in the Member State of the
super visor y author ity that adop ted the decision.
(130) Where the super visor y author ity with whic h the compl aint has been lodge d is not the lead super visor y author ity,
the lead super visor y author ity should closely cooperat e with the super visor y author ity with which the compl aint
has been lodg ed in accordance with the provisions on cooperation and consist ency laid down in this Regulation.
In such cases, the lead super visor y author ity should, when taking measures intended to produce legal effects,
including the imposition of administrative fines, take utmost account of the view of the super visor y author ity
with whic h the compl aint has been lodg ed and whic h should remain compe tent to carry out any investigation on
the territory of its own Member State in liaison with the compet ent super visor y author ity.
(131) Where another super visor y author ity should act as a lead super visor y author ity for the processing activities of
the controller or processor but the concrete subject matte r of a compl aint or the possible infringement concer ns
only processing activities of the controller or processor in the Member State where the complaint has been
lodg ed or the possible infringe ment detect ed and the matte r does not substantially affect or is not likely to
substantially affect data subjects in other Member State s, the super visor y author ity receiving a compl aint or
detecting or being informed other wise of situations that entail possible infringements of this Regulation should
seek an amicable settlement with the controller and, if this proves unsuccessful, exercise its full rang e of powers.
This should include: specific processing carried out in the territory of the Member State of the super visor y
author ity or with regar d to data subjects on the territory of that Member State; processing that is carried out in
the conte xt of an offer of goods or services specifi cally aimed at data subjects in the territory of the Member
State of the super visor y author ity; or processing that has to be assessed taking into account relevant legal
oblig ations under Member State law.
(132) Awareness-raising activities by super visor y author ities addressed to the public should include specifi c measures
direct ed at controllers and processors, including micro, small and medium-sized enter prises, as well as natural
persons in particular in the educational conte xt. 4.5.2016 L 119/24 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

*Page 25*

(133) The super visor y author ities should assist each other in performin g their tasks and provide mutual assistance, so
as to ensure the consistent application and enforcement of this Regulation in the intern al mark et. A super visor y
author ity requesting mutual assistance may adopt a provisional measure if it receives no response to a request for
mutual assistance within one month of the receipt of that request by the other super visor y author ity.
(134) Each super visor y author ity should, where appropr iate, participate in joint operations with other super visor y
author ities. The requeste d super visor y author ity should be oblig ed to respond to the request within a specified
time period.
(135) In order to ensure the consist ent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, a consistency mech anism
for cooperation between the super visor y author ities should be established. That mechani sm should in particular
apply where a super visor y author ity intends to adopt a measure intended to produce legal effects as regar ds
processing operations which substantially affect a signif icant number of data subjects in several Member State s. It
should also apply where any super visor y author ity concer ned or the Commission requests that such matte r
should be handled in the consiste ncy mechanism. That mechanism should be without prejudice to any measures
that the Commission may take in the exercise of its powers under the Treaties.
(136) In applying the consistency mechanis m, the Board should, within a determined period of time, issue an opinion,
if a majority of its members so decides or if so request ed by any super visor y author ity concer ned or the
Commission. The Board should also be empo wered to adopt legally binding decisions where there are disputes
between super visor y author ities. For that purpose, it should issue, in principle by a two-thirds major ity of its
members, legally binding decisions in clearly specifi ed cases where there are conf licting views among super visor y
author ities, in particular in the cooperation mec hanism between the lead super visor y author ity and super visor y
author ities concer ned on the mer its of the case, in particular whether there is an infringe ment of this Regulation.
(137) There may be an urgent need to act in order to prot ect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular
when the danger exists that the enforcement of a right of a data subject could be considerably impeded. A
super visor y author ity should theref ore be able to adopt duly justified provisional measures on its territory with a
specified period of validity which should not exceed three months.
(138) The application of such mechani sm should be a condition for the lawfulness of a measure intended to produce
legal effects by a super visor y author ity in those cases where its application is mandatory . In other cases of cross-
border relevance, the cooperation mecha nism between the lead super visor y author ity and super visor y author ities
concer ned should be applied and mutual assistance and joint operations might be carried out between the
super visor y author ities concer ned on a bilat eral or multilateral basis without trigge ring the consiste ncy
mech anism.
(139) In order to promot e the consiste nt application of this Regulation, the Board should be set up as an independent
body of the Union. To fulfil its objectives, the Board should have legal personality . The Board should be
represente d by its Chair . It should replace the Working Party on the Protect ion of Individuals with Regard to the
Processing of Personal Data established by Directive 95/46/EC. It should consist of the head of a super visor y
author ity of each Member State and the European Data Prote ction Super visor or their respective representatives.
The Commission should participate in the Board's activities without voting rights and the European Data
Prote ction Super visor should have specifi c voting rights. The Board should contr ibut e to the consistent
application of this Regulation throughout the Union, including by advising the Commission, in particular on the
level of prot ection in third countr ies or international organisations, and promoting cooperation of the
super visor y author ities throughout the Union. The Board should act independently when perf orming its tasks.
(140) The Board should be assisted by a secretar iat provided by the European Data Prot ection Super visor . The staff of
the European Data Prote ction Super visor involved in carrying out the tasks conferred on the Board by this
Regulation should perform its task s exclusively under the instr uctions of, and repor t to, the Chair of the Board.
(141) Ever y data subject should have the right to lodg e a complaint with a sing le super visor y author ity, in particular in
the Member State of his or her habitual residence, and the right to an effective judicial remedy in accordance 4.5.2016 L 119/25 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

---
*Page 26*

with Article 47 of the Char ter if the data subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are
infringe d or where the super visor y author ity does not act on a compl aint, partially or wholly rejects or dismisses
a compl aint or does not act where such action is necessar y to prot ect the rights of the data subject. The investi­
gation following a compl aint should be carried out, subject to judicial review , to the exte nt that is appropr iate in
the specific case. The super visor y author ity should inform the data subject of the progress and the outcome of
the compl aint within a reasonable period. If the case requires further inve stigation or coordination with another
super visor y author ity, intermediat e information should be given to the data subject. In order to facilitate the
submission of compl aints, each super visor y author ity should take measures such as providing a compl aint
submission form which can also be complet ed electronically , without excluding other means of communication.
(142) Where a data subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed, he or she should have
the right to mandate a not-f or-profi t body , organisation or association whic h is constitute d in accordance with
the law of a Member State, has statut ory objectives whic h are in the public inter est and is active in the field of
the protect ion of personal data to lodg e a compl aint on his or her behalf with a super visor y author ity, exer cise
the right to a judicial remedy on behalf of data subjects or, if provided for in Member State law, exercise the right
to receive compen sation on behalf of data subjects. A Member State may provide for such a body , organisation or
association to have the right to lodg e a compl aint in that Member State, independently of a data subject's
mandate , and the right to an effective judicial remedy where it has reasons to consider that the rights of a data
subject have been infringe d as a result of the processing of personal data whic h infringes this Regulation. That
body , organisation or association may not be allowed to claim compen sation on a data subject's behalf indepen ­
dently of the data subject's mandate .
(143) Any natural or legal person has the right to bring an action for annulment of decisions of the Board before the
Cour t of Justice under the conditions provided for in Article 263 TFEU. As addressees of such decisions, the
super visor y author ities concer ned whic h wish to challeng e them have to bring action within two months of
being notified of them, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Where decisions of the Board are of direct and
individual concer n to a controller , processor or compl ainant, the latter may bring an action for annulment
against those decisions within two months of their publication on the website of the Board, in accordance with
Article 263 TFEU. Without prejudice to this right under Article 263 TFEU, each natural or legal person should
have an effective judicial remedy before the compet ent national cour t against a decision of a super visor y
author ity which produces legal effects concer ning that person. Such a decision concer ns in particular the exer cise
of inve stigative, corrective and author isation powers by the super visor y author ity or the dismissal or rejection of
compl aints. However , the right to an effective judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by super visor y
author ities whic h are not legally binding, such as opinions issued by or advice provided by the super visor y
author ity. Proceedings against a super visor y author ity should be brought before the cour ts of the Member State
where the super visor y author ity is established and should be conduct ed in accordance with that Member State's
procedural law. Those cour ts should exer cise full jurisdiction, which should include jurisdiction to examine all
questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them.
Where a complaint has been rejected or dismissed by a super visor y author ity, the compl ainant may bring
proceedings before the cour ts in the same Member State. In the context of judicial remedies relating to the
application of this Regulation, national cour ts whic h consider a decision on the question necessar y to enable
them to give judgment, may, or in the case provided for in Article 267 TFEU, must, request the Cour t of Justice
to give a preliminar y ruling on the interpr etation of Union law, including this Regulation. Further more, where a
decision of a super visor y author ity implementing a decision of the Board is challenged before a national cour t
and the validity of the decision of the Board is at issue, that national cour t does not have the power to declare
the Board's decision invalid but must refer the question of validity to the Cour t of Justice in accordance with
Article 267 TFEU as interpreted by the Cour t of Justice, where it considers the decision invalid. However , a
national cour t may not refer a question on the validity of the decision of the Board at the request of a natural or
legal person which had the oppor tunity to bring an action for annulment of that decision, in particular if it was
directly and individually concer ned by that decision, but had not done so within the period laid down in
Article 263 TFEU.
(144) Where a cour t seized of proceedings against a decision by a super visor y author ity has reason to believe that
proceedings concer ning the same processing, such as the same subject matt er as regards processing by the same
controller or processor , or the same cause of action, are brought before a compet ent cour t in another
Member State , it should contact that cour t in order to conf irm the existence of such related proceedings. If
relat ed proceedings are pending before a cour t in another Member State, any cour t other than the cour t first 4.5.2016 L 119/26 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

---
*Page 27*

seized may stay its proceedings or may, on request of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction in favour of the
cour t first seized if that cour t has jurisdiction over the proceedings in question and its law permits the consoli ­
dation of such relat ed proceedings. Proceedings are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that
it is expedient to hear and determi ne them together in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments
resulting from separate proceedings.
(145) For proceedings against a controller or processor , the plaintiff should have the choice to bring the action before
the cour ts of the Member States where the controller or processor has an establishment or where the data subject
resides, unless the controller is a public author ity of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers.
(146) The controller or processor should compensat e any damage whic h a person may suffer as a result of processing
that infringes this Regulation. The controller or processor should be exem pt from liability if it proves that it is
not in any way responsible for the damag e. The concept of damage should be broadly interpr eted in the light of
the case-law of the Cour t of Justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation. This is
without prejudice to any claims for damage deriving from the violation of other rules in Union or Member State
law. Processing that infringes this Regulation also includes processing that infringes delega ted and implementing
acts adopt ed in accordance with this Regulation and Member State law specifying rules of this Regulation. Data
subjects should receive full and effective compen sation for the damag e they have suffered. Where controllers or
processors are involved in the same processing, each controller or processor should be held liable for the entire
damage . However , where they are joined to the same judicial proceedings, in accordance with Member State law,
compen sation may be appor tioned according to the responsibility of each controller or processor for the damage
caused by the processing, provided that full and effective compen sation of the data subject who suffered the
damage is ensured. Any controller or processor whic h has paid full compensation may subsequently institute
recourse proceedings again st other controllers or processors involved in the same processing.
(147) Where specific rules on jurisdiction are contained in this Regulation, in particular as regar ds proceedings seeking
a judicial remedy including compen sation, against a controller or processor , general jurisdiction rules such as
those of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) should not prejudice
the application of such specific rules.
(148) In order to strengthen the enforcement of the rules of this Regulation, penalties including administrative fines
should be imposed for any infringement of this Regulation, in addition to, or instea d of appropr iate measures
imposed by the super visor y author ity pursuant to this Regulation. In a case of a minor infringement or if the fine
likely to be imposed would constitut e a dispropor tionate burden to a natural person, a repr imand may be issued
inste ad of a fine. Due regar d should however be given to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, the
intenti onal charact er of the infringement, actions taken to mitig ate the damage suffered, degree of responsibility
or any relevant previous infringements, the manner in which the infringement became kno wn to the super visor y
author ity, compl iance with measures ordered against the controller or processor , adherence to a code of conduct
and any other aggra vating or mitig ating factor . The impos ition of penalties including administrative fines should
be subject to appropr iate procedural safeg uards in accordance with the general principles of Union law and the
Char ter, including effective judicial protection and due process.
(149) Member State s should be able to lay down the rules on criminal penalties for infringements of this Regulation,
including for infringements of national rules adop ted pursuant to and within the limits of this Regulation. Those
criminal penalties may also allow for the depr ivation of the profits obtained through infringements of this
Regulation. However , the imp osition of criminal penalties for infringe ments of such national rules and of
administrative penalties should not lead to a breac h of the principle of ne bis in idem, as interpret ed by the Cour t
of Justice.
(150) In order to strengthen and harmonise administrative penalties for infringements of this Regulation, each
super visor y author ity should have the power to impose administrative fines. This Regulation should indicate 4.5.2016 L 119/27 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN
(1)Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (OJ L 351, 20.12.2012, p. 1).

*Page 28*

infringe ments and the upper limit and criteria for setting the related administrative fines, which should be
determined by the compet ent super visor y author ity in each individual case, taking into account all relevant
circumstances of the specific situation, with due regar d in particular to the nature, grav ity and duration of the
infringe ment and of its consequences and the measures take n to ensure compl iance with the oblig ations under
this Regulation and to prevent or mitigat e the consequences of the infringement. Where administrative fines are
imposed on an under taking, an under taking should be understood to be an under taking in accordance with
Articles 101 and 102 TFEU for those purposes. Where administrative fines are imposed on persons that are not
an under taking, the super visor y author ity should take account of the general level of income in the Member State
as well as the economic situation of the person in consider ing the appropr iate amount of the fine. The
consiste ncy mechanis m may also be used to promote a consist ent application of administrative fines. It should be
for the Member States to deter mine whether and to which extent public author ities should be subject to adminis ­
trative fines. Imposing an administrative fine or giving a warning does not affect the application of other powers
of the super visor y author ities or of other penalties under this Regulation.
(151) The lega l systems of Denmark and Eston ia do not allow for administrative fines as set out in this Regulation. The
rules on administrative fines may be applied in such a manner that in Denmark the fine is imposed by compet ent
national cour ts as a criminal penalty and in Estonia the fine is imposed by the super visor y author ity in the
framew ork of a misdemeanour procedure, provided that such an application of the rules in those Member States
has an equivalent effect to administrative fines imposed by super visor y author ities. Theref ore the compet ent
national cour ts should take into account the recommendation by the super visor y author ity initiating the fine. In
any event, the fines imposed should be effective, propor tionate and dissuasive.
(152) Where this Regulation does not harmonise administrative penalties or where necessar y in other cases, for
examp le in cases of serious infringements of this Regulation, Member State s should implement a system whic h
provides for effective, propor tionate and dissuasive penalties. The nature of such penalties, criminal or adminis ­
trative, should be determined by Member State law.
(153) Member States law should reconcile the rules governing freedom of expression and information, including
jour nalistic, academic, artistic and or literary expression with the right to the protection of personal data
pursuant to this Regulation. The processing of personal data solely for jour nalistic purposes, or for the purposes
of academic, artistic or literary expression should be subject to derogations or exem ptions from certain
provisions of this Regulation if necessar y to reconcile the right to the prot ection of personal data with the right
to freedom of expression and information, as enshr ined in Article 11 of the Char ter. This should apply in
particular to the processing of personal data in the audio visual field and in news archives and press librar ies.
Theref ore, Member States should adopt legislative measures whic h lay down the exem ptions and derogations
necessar y for the purpose of balancing those fundamental rights. Member States should adopt such exem ptions
and derog ations on general principles, the rights of the data subject, the controller and the processor , the transfer
of personal data to third countr ies or international organisations, the independent super visor y author ities,
cooperation and consistency , and specifi c data-processing situations. Where such exem ptions or derog ations
diffe r from one Member State to another , the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject should
apply . In order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in ever y democratic
society , it is necessar y to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as jour nalism, broadly .
(154) This Regulation allows the principle of public access to official documents to be taken into account when
applying this Regulation. Public access to official documents may be considered to be in the public interest.
Personal data in documents held by a public author ity or a public body should be able to be publicly disclosed
by that author ity or body if the disclosure is provided for by Union or Member State law to which the public
author ity or public body is subject. Such laws should reconcile public access to official documents and the reuse
of public sector information with the right to the prot ection of personal data and may theref ore provide for the
necessar y reconciliation with the right to the prot ection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The
reference to public author ities and bodies should in that cont ext include all author ities or other bodies covered
by Member State law on public access to documents. Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of
the Council (1) leaves intact and in no way affects the level of prote ction of natural persons with regard to the 4.5.2016 L 119/28 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

processing of personal data under the provisions of Union and Member State law, and in particular does not alter
the obligations and rights set out in this Regulation. In particular , that Directive should not apply to documents
to whic h access is excl uded or restr icted by virtue of the access regimes on the grounds of prote ction of personal
data, and parts of documents accessible by virtue of those regimes which contain personal data the re-use of
whic h has been provided for by law as being incompatible with the law concer ning the protection of natural
persons with regar d to the processing of personal data.
(155) Member State law or collective agreements, including ‘works agreements’, may provide for specifi c rules on the
processing of emplo yees' personal data in the emp loyment context, in particular for the conditions under which
personal data in the emplo yment context may be processed on the basis of the consent of the emplo yee, the
purposes of the recr uitment, the performa nce of the contract of emplo yment, including discharg e of oblig ations
laid down by law or by collective agreements, management , planning and orga nisation of work, equality and
diversity in the workplace, health and safet y at work, and for the purposes of the exer cise and enjo yment, on an
individual or collective basis, of rights and benefi ts related to employment, and for the purpose of the
term ination of the emp loyment relationship.
(156) The processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientifi c or histo rical research
purposes or statistical purposes should be subject to appropr iate safeg uards for the rights and freedoms of the
data subject pursuant to this Regulation. Those safeguards should ensure that technical and organisati onal
measures are in place in order to ensure, in particular , the principle of data minimisation. The further processing
of personal data for archiving purposes in the public inter est, scientific or histo rical research purposes or
statistical purposes is to be carried out when the controller has assessed the feasibility to fulfil those purposes by
processing data which do not permit or no long er permit the identif ication of data subjects, provided that
appropr iate safeg uards exist (suc h as, for instance, pseudony misation of the data). Member States should provide
for appropr iate safeg uards for the processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public inter est,
scientific or histor ical researc h purposes or statistical purposes. Member States should be author ised to provide,
under specific conditions and subject to appropr iate safeguards for data subjects, specif ications and derog ations
with regard to the information requirements and rights to rectification, to erasure, to be forgotten , to restr iction
of processing, to data portability , and to object when processing personal data for archivin g purposes in the
public interest, scientifi c or histor ical researc h purposes or statistical purposes. The conditions and safeg uards in
question may entail specific procedures for data subjects to exer cise those rights if this is appropr iate in the light
of the purposes sought by the specific processing along with technical and organisational measures aimed at
minimising the processing of personal data in pursuance of the propor tionality and necessity principles. The
processing of personal data for scientific purposes should also compl y with other relevant legislation such as on
clinical trials.
(157) By coupling information from registr ies, researche rs can obtain new knowledge of great value with regar d to
widespread medical conditions such as cardio vascular disease, cancer and depression. On the basis of registr ies,
research results can be enhanced, as they draw on a larger population. Within social science, research on the
basis of registr ies enables researchers to obtain essential kno wledge about the long-t erm correlation of a number
of social conditions such as unem ployment and education with other life conditions. Research results obtained
through registr ies provide solid, high-quality kno wledge whic h can provide the basis for the formulation and
implementation of kno wledge-based policy , improve the quality of life for a number of people and improve the
efficiency of social services. In order to facilitate scientifi c researc h, personal data can be processed for scientifi c
research purposes, subject to appropr iate conditions and safeg uards set out in Union or Member State law.
(158) Where personal data are processed for arch iving purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that processing,
bear ing in mind that this Regulation should not apply to deceased persons. Public author ities or public or private
bodies that hold records of public inter est should be services whic h, pursuant to Union or Member State law,
have a legal obligation to acquire, preser ve, appraise, arrang e, descr ibe, communicat e, promote, disseminate and
provide access to records of endur ing value for general public inter est. Member States should also be author ised
to provide for the further processing of personal data for arch iving purposes, for example with a view to
providing specifi c information related to the political behaviour under former totali tarian state regimes, genocide,
crimes against humanity , in particular the Holocaust, or war crimes. 4.5.2016 L 119/29 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

*Page 30*

(159) Where personal data are processed for scientific researc h purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that
processing. For the purposes of this Regulation, the processing of personal data for scientifi c researc h purposes
should be interpreted in a broad manner including for example technological development and demonstration,
fundamental research , applied researc h and privately funded researc h. In addition, it should take into account the
Union's objective under Article 179(1) TFEU of achi eving a European Research Area. Scientific research purposes
should also include studies conduct ed in the public interest in the area of public health. To meet the specificities
of processing personal data for scientific research purposes, specifi c conditions should apply in particular as
regar ds the publication or other wise disclosure of personal data in the conte xt of scientifi c research purposes. If
the result of scientific research in particular in the health cont ext gives reason for further measures in the inter est
of the data subject, the general rules of this Regulation should apply in view of those measures.
(160) Where personal data are processed for histo rical research purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that
processing. This should also include histo rical researc h and research for genealogical purposes, bear ing in mind
that this Regulation should not apply to deceased persons.
(161) For the purpose of consenting to the participation in scientific research activities in clinical trials, the relevant
provisions of Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) should apply .
(162) Where personal data are processed for statistical purposes, this Regulation should apply to that processing. Union
or Member State law should, within the limits of this Regulation, deter mine statistical cont ent, control of access,
specifications for the processing of personal data for statistical purposes and appropr iate measures to safegua rd
the rights and freedoms of the data subject and for ensur ing statistical conf identiality . Statistical purposes mean
any operation of collection and the processing of personal data necessar y for statistical surveys or for the
production of statistical results. Those statistical results may further be used for diffe rent purposes, including a
scientific research purpose. The statistical purpose implies that the result of processing for statistical purposes is
not personal data, but aggreg ate data, and that this result or the personal data are not used in suppor t of
measures or decisions regar ding any particular natural person.
(163) The conf idential information which the Union and national statistical author ities collect for the production of
official European and official national statistics should be protect ed. European statistics should be developed,
produced and disseminated in accordance with the statistical principles as set out in Article 338(2) TFEU, while
national statistics should also comply with Member State law. Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European
Parliament and of the Council (2) provides further specific ations on statistical conf identiality for European
statistics.
(164) As regar ds the powers of the super visor y author ities to obtain from the controller or processor access to
personal data and access to their premises, Member States may adopt by law, within the limits of this Regulation,
specific rules in order to safeguard the profes sional or other equivalent secrecy oblig ations, in so far as necessar y
to reconcile the right to the prot ection of personal data with an oblig ation of professional secrecy . This is without
prejudice to existing Member State obligations to adop t rules on professional secrecy where required by Union
law.
(165) This Regulation respects and does not prejudice the status under existing constitutional law of churche s and
religious associations or communities in the Member States, as recognised in Article 17 TFEU.
(166) In order to fulfil the objectives of this Regulation, namely to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of
natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data and to ensure the free movement 4.5.2016 L 119/30 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

of personal data within the Union, the power to adop t acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be
delegat ed to the Commission. In particular , delegat ed acts should be adop ted in respect of criteria and
requirements for certification mechanisms, information to be present ed by standardised icons and procedures for
providing such icons. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropr iate consultations
during its preparatory work, including at exper t level. The Commission, when prepar ing and drawing-up
delegat ed acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropr iate transmission of relevant documents to the
European Parliament and to the Council.
(167) In order to ensure unif orm conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, imple menting powers should
be conferr ed on the Commission when provided for by this Regulation. Those powers should be exer cised in
accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. In that context , the Commission should consider specifi c
measures for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.
(168) The examination procedure should be used for the adop tion of implementing acts on standard contractual
clauses between controllers and processors and between processors; codes of conduct ; technical standards and
mech anisms for certificat ion; the adequate level of prot ection afforded by a third countr y, a territory or a
specified sector within that third countr y, or an intern ational organisation; standard prot ection clauses; formats
and procedures for the exchange of information by electronic means between controllers, processors and
super visor y author ities for binding corporate rules; mutual assistance; and arrangements for the exchange of
information by electronic means between super visor y author ities, and between super visor y author ities and the
Board.
(169) The Commission should adop t immediate ly applicable implementing acts where available evidence reveals that a
third countr y, a territory or a specifi ed sector within that third countr y, or an intern ational organisation does not
ensure an adequate level of protection, and imp erative grounds of urgency so require.
(170) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure an equivalent level of prote ction of natural persons and
the free flow of personal data throughout the Union, cannot be suffi ciently achieved by the Member States and
can rather , by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt
measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiar ity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union
(TEU). In accordance with the principle of propor tionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go
beyond what is necessar y in order to achi eve that objective.
(171) Directive 95/46/EC should be repealed by this Regulation. Processing already under way on the date of
application of this Regulation should be brought into conf ormity with this Regulation within the period of two
years after which this Regulation enters into force. Where processing is based on consent pursuant to Directive
95/46/EC, it is not necessar y for the data subject to give his or her consent again if the manner in whic h the
consent has been given is in line with the conditions of this Regulation, so as to allow the controller to continue
such processing after the date of application of this Regulation. Commission decisions adop ted and author isations
by super visor y author ities based on Directive 95/46/EC remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed.
(172) The European Data Protection Super visor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC)
No 45/2001 and delivered an opinion on 7 Marc h 2012 (1).
(173) This Regulation should apply to all matters concer ning the prote ction of fundamental rights and freedoms vis-à-
vis the processing of personal data whic h are not subject to specific oblig ations with the same objective set out in
Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), including the obligations on the
controller and the rights of natural persons. In order to clarify the relationship between this Regulation and
Directive 2002/58/EC, that Directive should be amended according ly. Once this Regulation is adopt ed,
Directive 2002/58/EC should be reviewed in particular in order to ensure consiste ncy with this Regulation, 4.5.2016 L 119/31 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

Principles
Article 5
Principles relating to processing of personal data
1. Personal data shall be:
(a) processed lawfully , fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and
transparency’);
(b) collect ed for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompati ble
with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or histo rical research
purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompat ible with
the initial purposes (‘pur pose limitation’);
(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessar y in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data
minimisation’);
(d) accurate and, where necessar y, kept up to date ; ever y reasonable step must be take n to ensure that personal data that
are inaccurat e, having regar d to the purposes for whic h they are processed, are erased or rectifi ed without dela y

*Page 36*

(e) kept in a form which permits identif ication of data subjects for no long er than is necessar y for the purposes for
which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insof ar as the personal data
will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or histor ical researc h purposes or
statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropr iate technical and
organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject
(‘stor age limitation’);
(f) processed in a manner that ensures appropr iate secur ity of the personal data, including prot ection against
unauthor ised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destr uction or damage , using appropr iate technical
or organisational measures (‘integri ty and confidentiality’).
2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).
Article 6
Lawfulness of processing
1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
(b) processing is necessar y for the perf ormance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps
at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract ;
(c) processing is necessar y for compliance with a legal oblig ation to which the controller is subject ;
(d) processing is necessar y in order to prot ect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
(e) processing is necessar y for the performa nce of a task carried out in the public inter est or in the exer cise of official
author ity vested in the controller ;
(f) processing is necessar y for the purposes of the legitimate inter ests pursued by the controller or by a third party,
excep t where such inter ests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
which require prot ection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public author ities in the performa nce of
their task s.
2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specifi c provisions to adap t the application of the rules of this
Regulation with regar d to processing for compl iance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more
precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for
other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapt er IX.
3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:
(a) Union law; or
(b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.
The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that lega l basis or, as rega rds the processing referred to in point (e)
of paragraph 1, shall be necessar y for the performa nce of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
official author ity vested in the controller . That legal basis may contain specifi c provisions to adap t the application of
rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the
types of data whic h are subject to the processing; the data subjects concer ned; the entities to, and the purposes for
whic h, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storag e periods; and processing operations and
processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specifi c 4.5.2016 L 119/36 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN

*Page 37*

processing situations as provided for in Chapt er IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of
public interest and be propor tionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
4. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for whic h the personal data have been collect ed is not based
on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law whic h constitut es a necessar y and propor tionate
measure in a democratic society to safeg uard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to
ascer tain whether processing for another purpose is compatib le with the purpose for which the personal data are
initially collected, take into account, inter alia:
(a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collect ed and the purposes of the intended
further processing;
(b) the conte xt in whic h the personal data have been collect ed, in particular regar ding the relationship between data
subjects and the controller ;
(c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special catego ries of personal data are processed, pursuant to
Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article
